Length: 35 cm (14 inches) Dishwasher safe Features an integrated hanging loop Key Features Non-stick safe KitchenCraft Professional uses only high-quality nylon that’s gentle on pans. This means when you scoop up servings of spaghetti or rigatoni, you won’t run the risk of damaging their non-stick coatings. Mess-free serving This pasta spoon is perfect for serving long pasta.
