  "description": "From the manufacturer The Quickshine brand is made in Great Britain, and trusted the world over. Bring Back the Shine. Restore the Sparkle. Place tarnished silverware and silver plated items into a bowl of boiling water with a Quickshine sachet, and a process of electrolysis begins, floating the tarnish away. At the same time, our unique formula removes dirt and grime. Your silver will be bright, shining and clean again within minutes. One sachet goes a long way and should be adequate for cleaning an average household's entire silver and jewellery collection. Now you can have polished silver with no work at all. Great for silver, gold, platinum and gemstones The non-toxic formula is safe for all silver and silver plate as well as gold, white gold and platinum. It is even effective on engraved and filigree pieces. Independently tested by the Cutlery and Allied Trades Retail Association and found to be safer on Silver Plate than traditional polish. Safe on Gemstones (Note: Do not immerse pearls, opals, marcasite wood, horn, leather or items with pitch weighted bases or handles). Choose your favourite. Quickshine makes it easy. Pure Silver Plating Spray, actually plates and re-pates with real silver. It will plate any base metal so can be used for craft projects as well as restoring worn silverware and jewellery. For Brass and Copper use Quickshine Brass and Copper Clean and Shine Bath. All it takes is a Quickshine sachet and just a few minutes. (Top Tip: if your Brassware is old, neglected and very heavily tarnished then follow the instructions on the packet except leave them to soak overnight and they will come out sparking like new).",
