  "description": "From the manufacturer back 2 nature small animal bedding and litter back 2 nature Small Animal Bedding and Litter Made in the UK Low dust for reduced irritations Soft on little feet and ankle joints Made from 99% recycled paper Highly absorbent Natural odour control For the past 10 years, back-2-nature has been providing comfy and safe little homes for our smallest of pets through their Small Animal Bedding &amp; Litter. Made from 99% recycled paper, back-2-nature’s flatter and ridged pellets allow for moisture to be absorbed rather than sitting on top of regular bedding, leaving the most delicate of feet dryer and less prone to irritations from standing in wet materials. With a flatter surface area, back-2-nature offers a safer experience for little paws and ankle joints as the pellets don’t roll around when hopped or scurried across. Sterile at point of manufacture Back-2-Nature is low in dust reducing the irritations that occur from hay and pine shavings. back-2-nature Small Animal Bedding and Litter can be composted once the waste is removed, but we recommend you check with your local council. Suitable for rabbits, rodents, ferrets, birds and reptiles.",
