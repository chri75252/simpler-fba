  "description": "Product Description Toilet cistern blocks clean and freshen toilets leaving a delicate fragrance after every flush as well as preventing limescale build up. Each block comes in a water soluble wrapper to prevent mess and are safe to use with septic tanks and all other toilet cleaners, including bleach. Ingredients Anionic surfactants over 30%, Perfume: Benzyl benzoate, Limonene Directions Clean toilet thoroughly, including under the rim. Remove a block from the pack (do not remove the wrapper as this will dissolve in the water). Drop the toilet block into the cistern by the float, at the opposite to the water inlet (handle). Allow 5 minutes for the block to settle before the first flush. When foaming, colour and fragrance fades, replace with another block to ensure your toilet remains clean and fresh. Store in a cool dry place. Do not use in porous or crazed cisterns. Safety Warning Keep out of reach of children. Keep away from food, drink and animal feeding stuffs. In case of contact with eyes or skin, rinse immediately with plenty of water and seek medical advice. If swallowed seek medical advice immediately (show the label where possible). See more",
