  "description": "Product Description Dry:Soon 3 Tier Heated Airer Cover Product features: Keeps heat in to improve airer performance and help dry your laundry quicker! Mesh side vents helps air flow better and prevent moisture build up inside the cover. Doubles as a handy storage bag for the folded airer, so it can be stored neatly away under the bed, or in your understairs cupboard. For the Dry:Soon 3 Tier Heated Airer. This clever cover is purpose-built to help your Dry:Soon Standard 3-Tier Heated Airer work even harder. Just slip it over the top and you’ll soon notice that the trapped heat means your clothes and laundry dry more quickly so you can pack your electric airer away and get your space back even sooner. Thoughtfully designed so that you can unzip the front panel and roll it up and tie it out of the way to get inside if you need to move your washing around, it’s also made of light poly-cotton which lets the moisture evaporate and is machine washable at 30°C. Three mesh panels at the base of the cover let air circulate for even faster drying and you can still access your dryer’s carry handle with the cover on – whether it’s folded or ready for use – thanks to two sensible slots on the top. And this cover doesn’t stop being useful when you come to pack the airer away. The side zips are there to help you compress the cover down to just the right size for storing your folded airer and stopping it from unfolding as you carry it, whether you’re sliding it under the guest bed or filing it in your wardrobe. Polyester cotton. Machine washable. For use with the 3-Tier Dry:Soon Standard Heated Airer. About Dry:Soon Heated Airers When we introduced our first heated tower airer in 2008 we knew it was a winner but we weren’t prepared for just how quickly it would race to the top of the best sellers list or how long it would stay there. Since then we’ve not only developed our Standard range but also introduced a Deluxe range, too, and a selection of handy accessories, in response to customer suggestions, to make them the best airers ever. Economical Our heated airers cost just pennies an hour to run. They’re also much kinder to clothes than tumble drying and neater and more efficient than laying laundry over your radiators. Versatile Not only do we offer a choice of designs and sizes, each version also benefits from folding shelves that can be positioned to suit your needs: you can dry T-shirts, socks or larger items over the rungs; lay delicate clothes flat to avoid stretching, or hang sheets and big towels over the top without them touching the floor. Convenient Made from light yet robust aluminium, Dry:Soon airers are easy to move around and fold down to 9cm or less deep for storage, ready to be pressed into action throughout the winter months, or whenever the weather isn’t cooperating.",
