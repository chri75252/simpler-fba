  "description": "Product Description Mr Muscle knows cleaning should be as easy as possible, which is why he's created a single product for all of your bathroom cleaning needs. Mr Muscle Advanced Power Bathroom Spray is formulated with the technology to give you the power to defeat tough messes in the bathroom. Directions To kill bacteria and viruses: Turn nozzle from STOP to spray position. For horizontal surface application, open the flap in the front of the nozzle and use on MIST position. For better results on vertical surfaces close the flap in front of the nozzle and use in 'FOAM' position. Spray pre-cleaned hard, non-porous surface until thoroughly wet, leave for at least 15 minutes and wipe. Turn nozzle to STOP position and store bottle upright. Avoid prolonged contact with wood, aluminium and painted, lacquered or soft porous surfaces. If in doubt refer to the manufacturer's instructions. Do not use on worn, damaged, cracked surfaces or on gold fittings. Manufacturer Contact Information SCJ Ltd. Camberley GU16 7AJ See more",
