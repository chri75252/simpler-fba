  "description": "Product Description Baby Nails is a wearable baby nail file, a safe and simple solution to baby nail care. Invented by Rebecca and Mark, parents to two small children, out of the necessity to care for their newborn son’s nails after they became first time parents in 2013. He wriggled a lot so they feared using baby nail clippers on his tiny fingers and toe nails. It became a stressful two-person task just to trim his nails. It's clever wearable design came to Rebecca whilst she was sat breastfeeding their newborn son. Baby Nails allows you to cuddle, feed or even read to your baby whilst filing their nails keeping them happy and relaxed. It offers a hands-free solution as the nail file is attached to the wearable Thumble so you can care for your baby without the worry of dropping the nail file. A newborn’s nails grow so fast and incredibly sharp too. They also wriggle a lot which can make cutting their tiny nails safely a challenge. Filing is the safest method when tending to a baby’s nails, helping to smooth and shape the nail and will avoid any accidents nipping your baby’s skin when using baby nail clippers. Keeping their nails short and smooth is very important to stop them scratching themselves and you. Used regularly Baby Nails is all that is needed for continued care of your baby’s nails from birth. As your baby grows and their nails get stronger (from 6 months+), we now include a pair of rounded edged baby scissors with our Mixed pack to assist in trimming your baby’s nails if needed. Don’t worry if the scissors leave a sharp edge as the Thumble can then be used to gently file and neaten up, leaving your baby’s nails smooth. The scissors can then be used throughout childhood so no need to invest further as they get older. Baby Nails is a new, unique and must-have baby product for all new parents. The ideal gift and must-have baby product for new or expectant parents, mums-to-be, parents-to-be and for baby showers. A hospital bag essential! After launching Baby Nails in 2015 it has become much loved by parents around the world. Rebecca and Mark have gone on to create the brand Thumble Baby Care making it their aim to bring unique products to the market that make every day parenting jobs a little easier and less stressful.

The Thumble has a flexible design so one size fits all and has an opening at the front for a long thumb nail.

We've received some amazing award tester panel feedback.... Tester Sophie, mum of 1, says: “The Thumble is an amazing invention. It allows you to comfortably and gently file your baby’s nails whilst they’re sleeping, feeding or just enjoying a cuddle. All without worrying that you’re going to hurt your precious newborn.” Made For Mums Awards 2020 Tester Charlene, mum of a 10 week old: \"This arrived safely and I liked the little pouch that came with the set to keep everything together. I think the idea of this is great. I always worried so much with my other 2 children about cutting their nails and keeping them short to stop them scratching themselves. The instructions are so easy to follow as you also have pictures to help you understand how to use everything. I found the Thumble very easy to use. The snap-off nail files were a breeze to use. I love this set and felt so much more confident using these items to keep my daughters nails manicured. This set helps keep her nails short and I had no reason to use scratch mittens. Loved the nice pouch as it kept all the items safe in one place. I used this every week. The contents and the whole set is great quality. Worth every penny as safe to use and never had any complaints from my daughter either. I just loved having a safe alternative to use to keep her nails short and loved the fact I did not have to use nail clippers as I always worried about using these. A great set to give any new mum or as a baby shower gift. I would buy this as works so well. Already recommended as it is a godsend. This set is ideal and helps keep those growing baby nails short and safe. Easy to use, comfortable for baby and all comes with a pouch to keep everything safe and handy when required. Just loved this set.\" BizzieBaby Awards 2020 INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE - 4 SIMPLE STEPS TO SAFE AND EASY FILING OF YOUR BABY'S NAILS Detach one of the included nail files by gently tearing along the perforated line. Peel off the backing to reveal the adhesive layer. When removing the backing off the adhesive part of the nail file make sure you don’t touch the adhesive part. The natural oils found in your skin can affect it’s stickiness. The nail file should stay stuck to the Thumble for the nail filing session. It will eventually pull away from the Thumble when stored away in the pouch/case but can be stuck down again when next needed or you can use a new nail file. Press the nail file firmly onto the Thumble making sure to press hard on the edges to ensure a good adhesion. Make sure the nail file is applied to the Thumble correctly. Follow the contour of the Thumble and make sure it doesn’t catch the raised lip above the 3 small holes. The Thumble is worn on the thumb. Whilst cradling your baby gently take one of their hands with the hand you are wearing the Thumble on and gently place their hand between your first two fingers. Starting from a corner of the fingernail, file in one sweeping direction along the nail. Once you have smoothed the nail in this direction, then move to the other corner of the nail and gently file in the opposite direction. File in one direction at a time along the contour of the nail until the nail is short. Do not rub or saw the nail file back and forth along the nail. Keep the nail file on the nail making sure you file the nail and not the tender skin under the nail bed.
