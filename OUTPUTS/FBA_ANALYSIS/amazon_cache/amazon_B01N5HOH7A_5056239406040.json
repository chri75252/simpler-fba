  "description": "Product Description Head Lice in the UK: A Growing Concern According to estimates, approximately one in three children aged 3 to 11 will get head lice at some point , making it a common problem in the UK. This is a significant number, and the problem is not going away any time soon. In fact, head lice are becoming more common and more difficult to treat due to the development of lice with resistance to treatment. This is a concern for families across the country. Children are particularly susceptible to getting lice due to their frequent close physical contact with each other. This is why head lice are commonly reported in schools and daycare centers. To prevent lice, it's important to be aware of the risk factors and take precautions. Having a Nit comb on hand in your household is a Smart Precaution for several reasons. Having a nit comb is a helpful tool for quickly and effectively identifying and removing lice from your child's hair. The fine teeth of the comb are closely spaced, making it easier to remove lice and their eggs, also known as nits. Using the OwnHealer nit comb is often the first step in treating head lice. Having a nit comb as part of your household hygiene toolkit is a safe, effective, and cost-effective solution for preventing and treating head lice. Knowing that you have a lice comb readily available can provide peace of mind and a sense of control. The OwnHealer Nit Comb Set offers a solution for families with different hair types. With only one nit comb, it can be challenging to protect everyone from the spread of lice. Head lice can be a frustrating and time-consuming issue, especially for families with varying hair types. The best solution is to invest in the OwnHealer comb set, which includes three different types of combs designed for various hair types and lengths. This ensures that everyone in the family can be properly checked and treated for lice if needed same time. The OwnHealer nit combs are made from high-quality stainless steel and plastic, providing durability and longevity. Additionally, the combs can be easily cleaned by boiling them in hot water for three minutes prior to reuse on other family members. Nit comb Micro-grooving on the needles of a metal comb is a design feature intended to help remove lice and their eggs (nits) from hair more effectively. The grooves help to grip and separate the hair, making it easier to remove lice and nits, and allowing the comb to glide through the hair more smoothly. Lice comb A plastic comb with metal smooth fine-toothed needles is typically used for removing head lice and their eggs from the hair. The fine, smooth needles make it easy to comb through the hair, especially for those with finer hair. This comb effectively removes lice and nits from the hair. Dandruff comb A double-sided plastic comb can be used for both removing head lice and nits from hair, as well as for removing dandruff from the scalp. The fine teeth of the comb help to effectively remove lice and nits from the hair, while also gently exfoliating the scalp to remove any dandruff flakes. User manual The OwnHealer comb set includes a user manual with step-by-step instructions on how to use the lice comb effectively to remove lice and their eggs from hair. The manual also includes practical tips for cleaning the home to prevent the spread of lice. Here is a simple method for checking for head lice using the OwnHealer Nit comb: Dry hair: Make sure the hair is dry, as lice and nits are easier to detect on dry hair. Part the hair into sections: Part the hair into sections, using hair clips or ties, to make it easier to comb through. Start combing: Choose a suitable lice comb from the set, gently comb through each section of hair, starting from the roots and working your way towards the ends, it should feel tight but not painful. Check for lice: After combing, examine the comb for any lice or nits. Repeat: Repeat the process, combing through each section of hair, to ensure you have thoroughly checked for lice. By using the OwnHealer nit comb, you can effectively check for head lice and nits. Regular checks can help detect head lice early and prevent them from spreading to other family members. Step-by-Step Guide on How to Remove Head Lice and Nits with the OwnHealer Nit comb set: Wet the hair with water and conditioner to help loosen the nits and make them easier to remove. Part the hair into small sections to make it easier to comb through. Choose a suitable lice comb from the set, gently comb through each section of hair, starting from the roots and working your way towards the ends, it should feel tight but not painful. After combing through a section, examine the comb for lice and nits. Repeat the combing process for each section of the hair until you have combed through the entire head. It's important to be thorough and to check the hair multiple times to make sure you've removed all the lice and nits. After each use, clean the comb by rinsing it with hot water and soap. Repeat the lice removal process every three days for at least two weeks to make sure all the lice and nits have been removed. Over-the-counter and prescription treatments can be effective, but they can also be expensive and may contain harsh chemicals that some parents prefer to avoid. Lice shampoo or treatments alone are not effective in eliminating lice because they may not reach all the lice and their eggs in the hair. The OwnHealer lice combs, with their fine teeth, can reach the scalp where lice and their eggs often reside and physically remove them. Using a lice comb in addition to lice shampoo or treatments is crucial for the thorough and effective treatment of Head lice. Tips for Cleaning the House After a Head Lice: Cleaning the house is important to prevent the re-occurrence and spreading of lice to others in the household. Clothing: Wash all clothing, bedding, and towels that have come into direct contact with the person who had lice in hot water to kill the lice and nits. Dry the items in a hot dryer for at least 20 minutes. Place any items that cannot be washed, such as stuffed animals and hats, in a sealed plastic bag for 2 weeks. Cleaning the Home: Vacuum all furniture and flooring, focusing on areas where the person who had lice may have come into direct contact. Soak combs, brushes, and personal items used by the person who had lice in hot water for 10 minutes. Clean any frequently touched surfaces, such as phone receivers and earphones. Cleaning the Car: Vacuum the entire car, paying special attention to seats and headrests where the person who had lice may have come into direct contact.
