    "✅ 𝗜𝗧 𝗖𝗟𝗘𝗔𝗥𝗦 𝗦𝗜𝗡𝗞 𝗕𝗟𝗢𝗖𝗞𝗔𝗚𝗘𝗦 𝗙𝗔𝗦𝗧: Place the large opening over your clogged plug pump it a two times. You'll clear more in 10 seconds than any other type of plunger. Guaranteed.",
    "✅ 𝗜𝗧 𝗖𝗟𝗘𝗔𝗥𝗦 𝗦𝗟𝗢𝗪 𝗔𝗡𝗗 𝗕𝗟𝗢𝗖𝗞𝗘𝗗 𝗗𝗥𝗔𝗜𝗡𝗦: Slow draining showers and baths are a common problem, the Luigi's plunger fixes it - everytime. Apply over the drain even when your shower tray is full and within a few pumps the cause of the blockage will be removed.",
    "✅ 𝗛𝗘𝗔𝗩𝗬 𝗗𝗨𝗧𝗬: The power comes from you pressing down on the bellows when it's over the plug, forcing the trapped air down the plughole. This is the same method as a traditional plunger, but with a much greater (8x) volume of air being forced down.",
    "✅ 𝗘𝗔𝗦𝗬 𝗧𝗢 𝗖𝗟𝗘𝗔𝗡: Made with 100% recycled PVC. When you're done just spray it with bleach and run it under the tap/shower.",
    "⚠️ 𝗣𝗥𝗢 𝗧𝗜𝗣: If you're clearing a sink or a bath where there is an overflow, block this with a damp cloth before you start to plunge. This stops the air from escaping and makes the process even quicker and easier."
