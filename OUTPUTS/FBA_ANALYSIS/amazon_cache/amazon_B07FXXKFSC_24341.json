You will find the holographic security label on Brother genuine cartridges. Check the package and security label has not been tampered with and verify the unique 7-digit ID No. at: www.brother.com/id What are the benefits of high yield toner cartridges over standard yield toner cartridges? High yield toner cartridges contain more toner for a higher page yield and lower cost per page. For those with high volume print needs, they also save you time by reducing the frequency of cartridge changes. How long will my toner cartridge last once open and installed in my printer? The toner cartridge shelf life is 2 years if the protective bag is unopened or 6 months after the protective bag is opened. Can I refill my toner cartridge after use? Brother recommends that customers use only genuine Brother toner cartridges. Each printer is designed to work at pre-set temperatures that are matched exactly to each of our individual toner formulations which non-genuine supplies may not do.",
