  "description": "Product Description Keep your surfaces spotless and cookware clean without creating any unsightly and unsanitary scratches with this heavy-duty green kitchen sponge scourer pad. Featuring a medium-abrasive construction, this general-purpose kitchen scouring pad acts tough on dirt and grime to provide an effective, non-scratch scrubbing solution for cleaning needs in your home, restaurant, bar, school or office. A Guaranteed Performance Booster! This green scouring pad does a magnificent job at scrubbing away heavy grime off stainless-steel surfaces, floors, cupboards, and more. It offers a safer and more efficient alternative to steel wool and metal sponges for cleaning equipment and surfaces while eliminating the chance of silvering, rusting, and staining the surface. Easily Reach Hard-to-reach Areas The flexible design of the pad enables you to easily reach hard-to-reach areas, difficult corners, and other nooks and crannies for effective cleaning results. It rinses easily and can be used repeatedly. Generous Size The large sponge scourer pad covers plenty of surface area and can last longer than traditional scouring pads. Thanks to its generous size, it can be folded or cut into smaller sections to get the job done while getting the most for the value.",
