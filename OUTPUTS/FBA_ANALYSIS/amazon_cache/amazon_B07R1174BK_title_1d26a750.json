  "description": "Product Description At a Glance Deep Cleaning &amp; Exfoliation Draws out bacteria, dirt, chemicals, poisons and other impurities from the skin, removing blackheads and combating acne. It also tightens pores and educes inflamation to create the appearance of smooth, youthful skin Contains Activated Bamboo Charcoal Charcoal that has been pulverised and steamed, giving it a wider surface area and thereby enabling it to absorb 200 times its volume of bacteria, toxins and blackhead causing micro-particles Contains Witch Hazel Wildly known for its ability to ease inflamation and sooth sensitive skin, useful in the treatment of acne Contains Glycerin A very effective skin moisturiser that can make your skin smooth by filling tiny cracks and prevent other problems associated with dryness, nourishing to keep your skin healthy, soft and fresh What happens when our pores get clogged? Pores are integral in keeping our skin healthy. These tiny openings are home to hair follicles and also let sweat leave our bodies. Oil, dead skin cells and everyday dirt can build up in our pores which can make them look bigger. If the blockages aren't cleared, our pores can become inflamed or infected which can result in different types of acne such as spots or blackheads. How do activated charcoal masks work? Black mask peel off face mask contains activated bamboo charcoal that has a spongy structure making it more absorbent. It can soak up pore clogging dirt and excess oil which is then pulled away with the mask, leaving cleaner, healthier skin. Why is Simply Sublime bamboo charcoal peel off mask the best? Simply Sublime Black Mask contains a rich blend of skin loving ingreedients in addition to activated bamboo charcoal, including glycerin known for its rich moisturising and nourishing properties and witch hazel which reduces infalmation and soothes sensetive skin. How to use After cleansing the skin, apply a medium, even layer to areas prone to impurities (nose, forehead, chin). Avoid the eye area, eyebrows, hairline and lips. Leave on for 15-20 minutes or until completely dry. Gently and slowly peel off the mask from the outer edges and rinse off any residue. If it feels too uncomfortable to peel, remove by rinsing with warm water. Use once or twice a week. Package includes Blackhead remover mask 1 pack 120g (enough for 15-20 applications) + 1 spatula",
