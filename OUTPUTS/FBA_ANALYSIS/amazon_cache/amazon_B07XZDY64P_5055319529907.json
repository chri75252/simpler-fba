  "description": "Rapide Silicone Grease Aerosol Spray is high performance, water resistant &amp; fast drying lubricant. Safe to use on rubber, vinyl and wood. Preparation Surface should be clean, dry and free of loose debris, dirt, rust, oil, grease. Surface may need sanding prior. Directions Use only as directed. Spray outdoors or in a well-ventilated area. Ensure the can is at room temperature before use. Avoid spraying in cold, damp, humid or windy conditions. Cover adjacent areas. Shake the can in a side-to-side “whisking” motion for 2 minutes prior and occasionally whilst in use to ensure uniformity and prevent clogging. Spray the can upright, 25-30cm from the surface using a smooth side-to-side motion. Build up coats with several thin layers, allowing approx. 20-30 minutes between each coat. After application touch dry in approx. 30 minutes and leave at least 24 hours to fully dry. Cleaning To prevent clogging for future use, clear the nozzle by turning the can upside down, then spray until the nozzle is clear. Additionally, remove the nozzle and soak in thinners. Storage Store in a cool, dry ventilated place. Avoid direct sunlight. Protect from frost and moisture. Caution When dry sanding, wear a suitable face mask and avoid dust inhalation. Special precautions should be taken during surface preparation of 1960’s paint surface over wood and metal as they may contain harmful lead. Testing The Product Patch test on an inconspicuous area first to determine the suitability of this product. Safety Device Fitted There may be a safety device fitted that prevents the nozzle depressing and releasing the spray. If this is the case, carefully remove the nozzle then using a slotted screwdriver, prise off the disc and replace the nozzle.",
