  "description": "One of the most humane ways of protecting other dogs and people around your dog. It's very sad to have to admit you need this muzzle, but for some dogs, it is essential to give you piece of mind. Your dog is probably very comfortable around your home and familiar environments, but when a dog is placed under stressful situations, whatever they may be, his or her temperament may change. Small children who climb on and try to play with your dog are a prime example. This muzzle is hygienic, washable and comfortable when fitted correctly. Selecting the correct muzzle for your dog: Use string or fabric tape to measure around your dogs nose. The muzzle must not be tight. Better a little loose than too tight!! Place your forefinger under the string to ensure enough space for your dog to be comfortable - don't tighten the string, it should be free to move around the dogs nose. Measure the string and check off the muzzle size - if its not an exact match then take to the nearest size. Fit the muzzle on your dog. Check the fit by running your finger inside the noseband. Your dog must be able to pant and have free tongue movement. Never leave your dog in a muzzle un-supervised.
