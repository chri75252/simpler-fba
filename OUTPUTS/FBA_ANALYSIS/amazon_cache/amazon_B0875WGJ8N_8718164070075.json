    "[ Upgraded Version ] See the second image. Muffin tray size is 27.8 x 19 x 5cm. It is larger and deeper than other muffin trays on the market. See the third picture. Because of the extra connection design between cups, our muffin mould is more stable and not flimsy than other soft and cheap version. Tips: Due to the soft nature of silicone, please place the muffin mold on your baking tray before filling and putting into oven to prevent spills. Fill and bake following your recipe instructions.",
    "[ Food Grade Material ] This silicone muffin mould is made from NO BPA food grade silicone. No cracking, odourless, non-toxic harmless. Our muffin pan can be used at temperature ranging from -40°F up to 450°f (-40°C to 230°C), suitable for oven, microwave, dishwasher and freezer.",
    "[ Non Stick And Easy Baking ] Thanks to the non-stick surface, your baked goods will not stick to the bottom of your baking tin. And this silicone muffin pan is flexible, so you can pop out the muffin cupcakes easily with pressed finger. Unlike the Carbon Steel tin, our non stick silicone coating of baking pan will not fall off or rust. Extremely long-lasting to use.",
    "[ Versatility ] These muffin tins not only can be used to bake muffins, but also ideal for making jumbo cupcakes, brownies, yorkshire pudding, pie crust, chocolate, egg muffins, cookies, cake pops, tarts, pudding, baked oatmeal cups,chicken pot pie cups and so on.",
    "[ Easy to Clean ] Thanks to the non-stick surface, you can clean our bakeware accessories easily. Just rinse them in soapy water for a couple of minutes, then wipe off with the wet cloth and allow to air dry. Or put the silicon baking sheet in the top rack of the dishwasher."
