  "description": "Product Description 100% Beef These chews contain just one ingredient...Beef. Not treated with any Nasty chemicals or preservatives and packed with all of the essential vitamins and minerals that your dog needs. If dogs had their say, this is what they'd choose. Easily Digestible The whole stick is fully digestible, we recommend supervision to prevent them being swallowed whole. Fresh water should be made available at all times and as a guide we recommend feeding between 1-2 sticks per day. Always feed as part of a healthy, balanced diet. Rawhide Alternative This is Animal flesh and a much safer alternative to rawhide chews and bones. There’s also less chance of these splintering and causing your dog harm. Long Lasting These chews are great as a boredom buster and one stick can last up to an hour depending on the size of your dog. These are great for larger breeds and those with tough jaws. We offer 3 different sizes in these chews (12cm, 15cm, 20cm and 30cm). If you're looking for longer lasting chews or have a large breed, we recommend at least 15cm. However these are perfect for dogs of all breeds and weights. Cleans Teeth &amp; Gums Beef Pizzle Sticks are perfect for removing the build-up of Tartar, keeping teeth and gums clean and healthy. These act as a natural toothbrush for your dog and one stick a day can help to keep on top of their oral health.",
