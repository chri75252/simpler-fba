  "description": "Product Description Fretting about traditional toilet cleaner cages that harbour germs? Fret no more. Duck Fresh Discs Lime have a gel-based formula that self-sticks to the toilet bowl so germy cages aren’t something to fret about. On top of that, they use 30 Percent less plastic than rimblocks (over 6 months of use). Fresh Discs prevent the build up of limescale and germ-harbouring stains. Just stick one to the inside rim of the toilet bowl so you can keep things clean with a fresh Lime scent. No touching or scrubbing required, just automatic freshening action with every flush. Pretty easy, huh? Starter kit contains handle and 18 gel discs, and both the handle and blister are recyclable*.&nbsp;It's not rocket science. It's Duck science. *Please recycle: check locally if facilities exist in your area Directions HOW TO USE: Ensure the toilet is clean. 1. Align large button on gel holder with holes on handle. Remove cap and keep. 2. Position clear end of gel holder against inside surface of bowl where water will flow when flushed. Press and hold button whilst pushing dispenser against bowl until button clicks. 3. Pull dispenser straight back to leave a gel disc. 4. Replace cap tightly. Flush toilet to activate gel disc. After application, disc may be attractive to young children. Use product in an area least visible by children. Suitable for septic tanks. 5. After dispensing the last gel disc, twist the gel holder slightly and remove from dispenser. Keep handle for refill.
