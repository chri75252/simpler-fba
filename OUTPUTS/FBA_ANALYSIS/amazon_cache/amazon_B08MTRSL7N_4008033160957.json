Different usage environments have different requirements for grass-cloth nails. Green-painted grass clippings are suitable for landscaping environments where aesthetics are important, while galvanized silver grass clippings offer excellent corrosion resistance due to their galvanized coating. We understand that cost is a concern for our customers and therefore offer a range of products at different price points.
