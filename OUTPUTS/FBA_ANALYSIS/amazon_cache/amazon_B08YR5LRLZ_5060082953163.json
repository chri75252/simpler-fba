  "description": "Product Description Brave pilots in amazing planes Here is a puzzle with an amazing mix of airplanes in a spectacular air show. We included a multicopter and a winged jetpack to show technical innovations that are under development and that we believe will come in the future. In the upper left corner you see a Boeing Stearman Biplane from the USA in the 1930s, with a lady standing on top of the plane. Here are biplanes and a triplane, paraglider and helicopter. Fighter planes and bombers are painted with fresh, friendly colours. Many of the pieces are cut out along the contours of the image, and some pieces are shaped like airplanes. The puzzle with 64 pieces is best suited for slightly older children. Figure and Contour Pieces This puzzle has pieces shaped as interesting figures, as well as pieces that follow the contours of the illustration. Having recognisable pieces not only makes the puzzle more fun to play with, but it helps teach shapes. It also gives a little bit of extra help with the puzzle since these pieces makes for a good place to start the puzzle. Imagination This puzzle has an illustration that is meant to trigger the imagination and to let the child come up with their own story for the jigsaw puzzle. If a parent, sibling or other family member is helping the child with the puzzle, we encourage them to tell one of the many possible stories. Not only does this improve the quality of the group activity, but it spurs the imagination and creativity of both parties. Figure and Contour Pieces Imagination Since we started making puzzles in 1953, our philosophy has always been to make the highest quality children puzzles we can. We have always manufactured all of our puzzles ourselves in our factory on the southern coast of Norway. This way we have full control over both the quality and materials of our puzzles to make sure they meet our strict requirements. Our puzzles should not just be fun to play with and beautiful to look at with colourful illustrations, but should also encourage learning. The act of puzzling help develop fine motor skills, cognitive skills, and shape recognition. In addition, we have many educational puzzles for all ages on topics such as the letters and numbers, reading, maths and learning the clock. Maps and geography have always been a focus area for us, and we produce over 100 puzzles with maps of countries, continents, states, and various other areas. We also have many scientific and historical puzzles for various subjects such as animals, transportation, space, climate and nature. All our puzzles are made with tray and a permanent edge that holds the pieces in place while puzzling. This also removes the need for a bulky storage box, so the puzzles are very easy to store. The imprint of the pieces are always visible in the tray. And since most of our jigsaw puzzles have easily distinguishable pieces, the tray can be a helpful guide. There are always one or more small holes in the tray to make it easier to remove the first piece when starting. The puzzle dimensions are 36.5 x 28.5 cm and it's 0.5 cm thick. While this doesn't sound like a lot, it's thicker and sturdier than most tray jigsaw puzzles. This makes it easier to handle for puzzlers of all ages, while also making it very long-lasting and durable. We only use 100% recycled cardboard specifically designed for puzzles, and our puzzles of course meet all the stringent safety requirements for toys.",
