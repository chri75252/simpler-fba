  "description": "From the manufacturer Must-have crafting supplies The Springboard glitter card multipack provides a sparkling, colourful, artistic gateway to limitless crafting possibilities. Each glitter card sheet is made from premium quality materials and finished with dazzling, non-shed glitter. This sturdy yet pliable card holds its glitter and lends itself to a whole spectrum of arts and crafts activities and decorative projects, from card making to cake toppers to 3D creations and more, all without leaving a trail of sparkly mess in its wake! An essential addition to any school’s art department or artists’ craft supplies, these attractive glitter card sheets will elevate any project with a high-quality, professional-looking finish. A4 SIZE: Each A4 single-sided glitter card sheet measures 210 mm x 297 mm and is crafted from a premium 290 gsm card that’s not too thick or thin. ONE-SIDED: On one side, you’ll find the brightly coloured non-shed glitter and, on the other, a plain white backing, ideal for writing personalised messages or illustrating. STRONG GLITTER CARDSTOCK: Each sheet is reassuringly strong yet supple and specially designed to yield whilst remaining durable. MULTIPACK OPTIONS: Choose from single-colour 10-packs, assorted coloured 30-packs, or fluorescent-coloured 5-packs: everything you could need for all your creative endeavours. GET CRAFTING: Each glitter card sheet meets our exacting, high-quality standards. Whether you’re designing an invitation for a birthday party, crafting a cake topper for a wedding anniversary, or the whole class is collaborating on a festive-themed collage, your creations will go the distance. ESSENTIAL CRAFT SUPPLIES: A must-have addition to any school’s art department or artists’ craft supplies, these attractive glitter card sheets will elevate any project with a high-quality, professional-looking finish. Craft Cards Creating eye-catching cards is a simple 2-step process. Fold the glitter card sheet in half, keeping the white side on the inside for your personalised messages. Using an adhesive, stick cutout glitter card shapes to the front of the card for a dazzling birthday, Easter, or Christmas card to remember. Classroom Collaborations Art class just got a lot more exciting. If you’re looking for a group activity to encourage creative crafting and decorating, these glitter card sheets hold the answer. Cut out a variety of glitter card shapes and promote positive social interaction by creating an eye-catching group collage. 3D Structures Glitter cardstock can be used for a variety of other crafts. Each 290 gsm A4 glitter card sheet is supple enough to fold yet strong enough to hold its shape and provide a stable base. Create 3D, freestanding card sculptures for classroom displays or even to adorn a cake. Elevate your cakes If you’re a budding Prue Leith or Paul Hollywood, these food-safe glitter card sheets are essential for your cake-decorating supplies. NON-TOXIC: Each glitter card sheet is non-toxic, with no strong adhesive odour, and is crafted with non-flammable glue—in case a chorus of birthday candles surrounds your showstopping cake topper! DIE-CUTTING COMPATIBLE: The glitter card sheets are also compatible with die-cutting machines, so you can really get ambitious with your decorative finishing touches. DAZZLING DESIGNS: With a decadent buttercream frosting, some delicate sugar flowers, and a glitter card cake topper centrepiece, your cake will look almost too good to eat!
