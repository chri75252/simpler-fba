  "description": "Product Description Work relaxed with the Broadfork garden fork Treat your soil to a gentle and humus-building treatment. For more yield and good soil fauna Backache, beads of sweat on your forehead and no end to the work? That's a thing of the past with the TERRADIX Broadfork. Tilling the soil has never been so easy, energy-saving and quick. The Broadfork is an indestructible universal tool for your garden. Those who have it will love it and soon realise how indispensable it is in everyday gardening. In the long run, your soil will thank you for the gentle cultivation with a rich harvest. Loosening instead of digging over The complete turning or tilling of the soil severely affects soil organisms. Plants, however, depend on an intact soil fauna. This is the only way to achieve good nutrient exchange of the plants. The Broadfork gently loosens and aerates the soil. Organisms are thus preserved and have a lasting positive effect on soil fertility. TERRADIX Broadfork 5x300 Extra stable and durable 50cm working width 30cm tine length Made of high-strength tool steel Super ergonomic thanks to all-round handle Working without blisters on the hands Technical refinements that make the difference... Through-going tines The TERRADIX Broadfork has continuous tines, i.e. the tines are crossing the tube twice. This provides extreme stability in all load directions while at the same time keeping the tube thickness low and thus the weight low. Welded on both sides The tines are welded on both sides of the tube (upper and lower side). The tines of the TERRADIX Broadfork are also made of high-strength tool steel. This is three times stronger than normal steel. High design Most gardeners will be familiar with broken or bent tines on conventional digging forks. The problem is that the tines are usually flat, which means that there is little material to counteract the high forces in the direction of the load. Even a small root or a bent stone can cause the tines to bend or break. The TERRADIX Broadfork is different. Here the tines are arranged on edge in the direction of the load and have a lot of material exactly where the forces are highest. Bending of the tines is therefore almost impossible.
