  "description": "From the manufacturer Makita E-12930 TCT Saw Blade for Wood Makita's EFFICUT saw blades are up to 2.5 times faster compared to standard saw blades. The new tips are designed to reduce contact with the material, increasing the efficiency of release waste and a sharper bevel angle. Cuts are more efficient, enabling the battery to last up to 2.4 times longer compared to a standard blade. The E-12930 has been designed specifically for cutting wood and straight cutting; the load on the blade tips is distributed evenly suppressing the wobble on the saw blade to provide a steady straight cut and increased durability against breaking the tips. E-12930 is especially suitable for use with Makita HS011G 40V Max XGT Circular Saw, has a diameter of 270mm, 30mm bore, 24 teeth, AFTAR tooth shape, 23 degrees rake and 2.15mm kerf. The maximum cutting depth with E-12930 is 101mm. The E-12930 has the capability of cutting a 100mm sleeper in one cut.",
