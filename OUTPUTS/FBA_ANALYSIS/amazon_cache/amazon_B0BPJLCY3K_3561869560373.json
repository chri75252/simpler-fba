  "description": "From the manufacturer Preparation is the science behind the baking, where all the magic is truly held! Having quality equipment isn't essential for a good baker, but it can make your job a whole lot easier. Our soft handled preparation utensils are designed for comfortable baking prep. From our robust stainless steel balloon whisks to our silicone bowl scrapers, our utensils are designed to withstand extensive baking prep with comfort at the forefront of design. Elevating your bakes all starts with the pallette knife. The foundational tool of a show stopping bake, our angled pallette knife is designed in stainless steel with a soft touch plastic handle for creating an even finish on your icing at complex angles. The ultimate partner for our Bake Off cake stand and piping nozzles, our cake decorating tools are perfect for those with a passion for elevating the visuals of their bakes. In the Bake Off tent, flavour will always ultimately trump design. A vital tool for flavouring your crumb is our stainless steel Lemon Zester. Fitted with a soft-touch silicone handle to facilitate strenuous zesting jobs, our Zester employs micro planing technology to facilitate a variety of food groups. From citrus fruits, to chocolate, to tough foods like ginger and garlic, this 30cm Zesting tool is designed to accommodate the whole range of flavour enhancing ingredients. You've planned the perfect recipe, flavoured it with the finesse of a Star Baker, and poured hours of innovation into your decoration, now it's time to present.
