Simply upload your photo and we'll send your masks in the post. Cut at Home, Precut and Ready to Wear Cut at home (DIY) - we will cut out the eyes for you, but you'll need to cut out the masks &amp; attach the fixings at home. We supply everything, all you need is a sharp pair of scissors. Precut - we cut out the eyes &amp; the masks for you, so all you'll need to do at home is apply the supplied fixings. Ready to wear - We do everything for you - the masks will come cut out with the fixings attached. What makes a great mask? High quality images For a high quality image, the bigger the photo the better. The best images to send us are direct from your phone camera or PC. To check if the photo is high quality, try zooming into the picture on your device and see how it looks! Forward facing images A forward facing shot only is heavily advised - looking at the camera please! No closed eyes are best for an ideal finished product. Close-up photo Close-ups are best, if they're in the distance they'll be fuzzy! *Note* Any problems with your photo may delay your order.
