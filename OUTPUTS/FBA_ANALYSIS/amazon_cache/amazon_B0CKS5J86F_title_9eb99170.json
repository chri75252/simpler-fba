Once Every 4-6 Weeks Once Every 4-6 Weeks Daily Daily Permanency Level Permanent Demi-Permanent - - How do I know what colour is right for me? We suggest that you choose a colour that is no more than two shades lighter or darker than your current hair colour. What if I currently use your custom colour? Can I find a perfect colour match? Please consult with your Colorsmith colourist. With custom colour, we use different pigments, developers, and formula types to match your goals. As this is a one-size-fits-all product, this formula may be different than what you are currently using. What is the difference between permanent and demi-permanent hair dye? Permanent dye often lasts longer than demi-permanent hair dye while providing up to 100% grey coverage. Demi-permanent hair dye often fades naturally over time and offers more subtle grey coverage. Both are Ammonia-, Resorcinol-, and PPD-free. How long will this hair colour last? It can vary depending on the condition of your hair, how often you wash your hair, and what types of products you use. Generally, you can expect this hair colour to resist fading for about 24 washes. Will I have an allergic reaction to this hair dye? We highly recommend performing an allergy test before using this product. Although our dye is designed to be allergy-friendly with an Ammonia-, Resorcinol-, and PPD-free formula, we cannot predict how your skin will react.",
