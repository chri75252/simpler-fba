Please Note, Antlers are Purchased by Weight Rather Than Length or Thickness. Preparation -To prepare antlers into chews we take important stages to ensure highest quality &amp; nutritious treats.

CUTTING This stage is only done by professional trained staff to ensure quality &amp; equal sizes of chews. All unwanted 'spiky' antlers tips are removed for dog's safety while chewing .

By sanding sharp edges &amp; uneven surface we will ensure there is no danger or discomfort for the dog while chewing. Dog Chew Antlers are safe chews for dog to enjoy and keep a good dental health.
