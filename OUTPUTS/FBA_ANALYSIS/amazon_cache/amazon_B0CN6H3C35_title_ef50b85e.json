    "Size: 650ml (22.88 Oz) | Quantity: 100 Containers with Lids | Material: BPA Free Heat Resistant Polypropylene",
    "Our containers are made of BPA free food grade material so they can be used to store all types of food items. Their versatility allows them to be used both at home and business. These are equally good to store and display non-food items also.",
    "These containers provide maximum strength and resilience whilst utilitising the minimum amount of polymer for obvious environmental issues. This plastic grade is also a mono-polymer that can be fully recycled and if properly collected, cleaned and re-granulated it can make the same product once again – a true circular economy food storage solution",
    "Designed for safe use in dishwashers, microwaves and freezers. Your food products can go from freezer (storage) straight to microwave (cooking) to dishwasher (ready for reuse) to freezer(storage) again. These containers are suitable to go many times around in a circular multi-use because these are intended for reuse and not just single use",
    "The lids are designed to be leakage proof even after multiple uses through washing, heating and freezing"
