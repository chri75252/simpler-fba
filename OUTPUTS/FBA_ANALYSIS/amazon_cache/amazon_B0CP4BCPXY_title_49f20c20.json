  "description": "Product Description Baby Petroleum Jelly By Eternal Beauty. SHEA BUTTER JELLY Like coconut oil, shea butter is a fat that comes from a tree nut — specifically, from the shea nut of the karite tree in western and central Africa. It’s been used locally for hundreds of years on skin and hair as a natural moisturizer and treatment for variety of ailments, like rashes and insect bites. It’s now become massively popular worldwide. Shea butter is a solid at room temperature but melts to a liquid once heated. It’s primarily made up of saturated fatty acids like palmitic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acid. It also contains certain vitamins, like vitamin E. ORIGINAL JELLY Chapped Cheeks or Lips: In cold or windy weather, a small amount of baby jelly can be applied to chapped cheeks or lips to provide a protective barrier and help soothe the skin. It is made with triple-purified petroleum jelly to help heal dry and chafed skin caused by diaper rash. Creates a protective layer to keep out wetness and prevent friction between the diaper and your baby’s skin. Keeps your baby’s skin feeling soft, smooth, and protected. Hypoallergenic, paediatrician-recommended, and gentle on sensitive skin, with a light baby powder fragrance. Relieves symptoms of diaper rash to soothe your baby’s skin, restore softness, and prevent irritation. LAVENDER JELLY Minor Skin Irritations: Baby jelly can be used for minor skin irritations, such as dry or irritated patches, but it's important to ensure that the specific product you're using is safe for babies.
