    "【Premium Stainless Steel Bowl + Filter Cotton Design】The cat bowl is made of 304 stainless steel to ensure durability, hygiene and easy cleaning. A filter is incorporated at the water dispenser's outlet to prevent dust from entering the water tank to maintain clean water. All these features are designed to ensure your pet’s drinking water is healthy. (We recommend cleaning the filter at least once a week.)",
    "【Gravity Feeding System】This pet water dispenser uses gravity to slowly release water into the bowl, ensuring it doesn’t overflow. When the water level in the bowl drops below a certain point, it automatically refills to save you from frequent refilling. Feeding by gravity is reliable because it does not require batteries or cords. So you won’t have to worry about your pet going thirsty even during power outages.",
    "【Large Capacity】The pet feeder holds up to 3.85L water, enough to last a medium-sized pet for a week. Whether you’re traveling or busy with work, you won’t have to worry about your pet running out of water.",
    "【Easy to Detach and Clean】The water dispenser features a modular design. The water tank and base can be easily separated for cleaning. Its transparent exterior makes it convenient to monitor the remaining water level and refill when necessary. We recommend cleaning the dispenser weekly.",
    "【Stable and Spill-Resistant】The widened base combined with an anti-slip design to ensures stability and make it harder for your pet to tip over the dispenser while drinking. The water bottle and base are tightly connected via threading. Additionally, the deepened water bowl minimizes spillage to provide your pet a better drinking experience."
