Quassia bark An effective hair parasite treatment - antiparasitic and anti-inflammatory. Lemongrass essential oil A natural insect repellent - safe around both dogs and cats. Rosemary An excellent flea, mite and tick deterrent. Lavender essential oil Calming for pets and off-putting for insects Aren’t some essential oils like lemongrass poisonous to cats, yet you use lemongrass in this spray? Yes, it is poisonous if ingested in large quantities, but our product is non-toxic and safe when used as a spray because we only use a tiny amount – just enough to deter fleas. Lemongrass is commonly used in many other natural flea sprays &amp; products. Can I use this spray on all materials? The spray is safe to use on any materials that will not stain when dampened – carpets, dog beds, blankets, cushions, toys etc. It can be used both as a flea deterrent or simply just to freshen. Do we need to vacate the property for a time period after using the spray? There is no need to leave the property, but we would suggest keeping the room/surfaces clear of pets for 10-15 minutes to allow the spray time to settle and dry out slightly and to avoid any transference of damp spray to their paws or coat.",
