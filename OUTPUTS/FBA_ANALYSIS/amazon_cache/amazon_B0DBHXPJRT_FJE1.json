  "description": "The quick way to your rescue card A rescue card is an important tool to efficiently remove people from their vehicle in the event of a traffic accident. This map lists crucial components of the respective vehicle, including airbags, belt tensioners, battery, fuel tank and body reinforcements. Our QR code can be scanned with any smartphone. A vehicle-related rescue card is displayed. This supports the fire brigade during vital recovery steps. It helps to quickly and safely find the optimal points of attack for rescue equipment such as spreaders and rescue scissors. Our database Our database already contains over 2800 vehicle models from 90 different brands. The rescue cards offered are continuously updated and expanded. If you do not find a suitable QR code here, you can simply send us your vehicle identification number (FIN/VIN). We take care of the rest and send you the matching digital rescue card.
