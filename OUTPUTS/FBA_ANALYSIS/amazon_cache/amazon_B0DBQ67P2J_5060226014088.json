    "Material: Features a Φ5MM, chew-proof, rust-proof stainless steel wire core with PVC plastic-coating.",
    "Sufficient Length: The 15-meter length gives the dog more space to move around, meeting its activity needs, while also allowing the owner and the dog to maintain an appropriate sense of distance.",
    "Good Workmanship: smooth surface without burrs, good toughness, not easy to rust or break.",
    "Shock-absorbing & Tangle-Free: Equipped with a heavy-duty locking carabiner and 360° swivel design to prevent tangling. Includes a spring to reduce jerking and protect dogs from sudden pulls.",
    "Intimate design: The PVC plastic-coating layer not only increases the comfort of holding, but also prevents the steel wire from directly contacting the skin and clothing to avoid scratches. It is also waterproof, stain-resistant and easy to clean."
