  "description": "Product Description NATURAL ECO-MATERIAL Breathable, recycled cotton outer layer and lining reduce irritation from long-term wear, reduce waste and protect natural resources. WATER-REPELLENT Eco (flurocarbon-free) water repellent coating protects the environment from toxins whilst keeping your cat’s neck dry and comfortable. REFLECTIVE A silver 'retroreflective' material at the top and bottom of the collar reflects light, making your cat visible and safer in the dark. BREAK-AWAY BUCKLES Quick-release buckle, as recommended by vets, releases at 3.5kg pressure to free your cat if the collar gets caught. For proper fitting, see our fitting notes. ANTI-FRAY Unlike cheaper nylon alternatives, this collar has been crafted to be robust and durable, by resisting fraying. Keeping it looking good for a long time. DOUBLE D-RINGS Two D-rings allow extra tags or charms to be attached. Lightweight plastic hardware prevents corrosion and keeps your cat’s fur unstained. Additional Accessory Options Beau’s Bells - The original, extra loud, handcrafted, recycled copper bells producing a loud, clear ring when your cat is on the move helping warn wildlife of their presence and letting you know their whereabouts when they are out of sight. Supplied with the new QuickLoop connector. AirTag Holder - A secure black silicone holder for your AirTag (AirTag itself is not included!). Simply squeeze your AirTag inside and slide your collar through the attachment on the rear. Attachment is perfectly sized for our collars to prevent sagging. Collar fitting notes For your cat’s comfort and safety, it’s important to fit the collar appropriately. Size - Our collars fit cat’s necks from 17.5cm to 26cm circumference while leaving a gap of around 1.5cm. This should fit most adult cats and kittens from 3 months of age. Gap - Cats Protection recommend leaving a two-finger gap between the collar and your cat’s neck. If you find that this leads to your cat losing their collar or scratching it off, try leaving a 1-finger gap. We find that this hits the sweet spot of comfort and safety while reducing the chances of the collar getting snagged and coming off unnecessarily.",
