    "Strong Driving Force: The powerful motor enables the interactive cat ball toy to move quickly on thick carpets, thin carpets, and hard floors. However, the movement speed on carpets is slightly slower than that on hard floors. If you notice a significant slowdown in running speed compared to before, follow the instructions to clean the hair on the connecting rod",
    "Skin-friendly Material: The surface of the ball is made of flocking and silica gel. The fluffy touch makes cats willing to get close to it. The 2.3-inch size is suitable for adult cats and kittens. You can regularly wipe the dirt on the surface of the toy ball",
    "Two Interaction Modes: Press and hold the button for 1 second to activate the slow mode (the red light flashes and then turns off). It is suitable for timid, less active, or older cats. We have specifically turned off the light for these cats to avoid scaring or harming their eyes. Press the button again briefly to switch to the fast mode (the blue light is on continuously). This mode is applicable to all surfaces such as carpets and hard floors and is ideal for bold and energetic adult cats",
    "Interesting Tail Accessory: The elastic tail accessory and the ball move quickly together, making cats think this is an agile mouse and go crazy for it. In the package, we have included two tail accessories for your convenience to replace",
    "Motion Activatied: After the cat toy is turned on and you play with your cat for 3 minutes, it enters standby mode. When your cat pats or touches it again, it will be reactivated to play with your cat for another three minutes. During each activation, a bird chirping sound will be emitted to attract cats to chase and catch, stimulating their hunting instincts",
    "Rechargeable: The electric ball has a built-in 600mAh rechargeable battery. It is recommended that you use a mobile phone charger and the Type-C USB cable included in the package to charge the interactive cat toy. There is no need to purchase additional batteries",
    "Warm Tip: The electric ball toy is not waterproof. Please use the damp cloth (included) to clean the dirt on the surface. If you receive a defective ball or encounter any problems during use, please contact our after-sales team. We will surely satisfy you"
