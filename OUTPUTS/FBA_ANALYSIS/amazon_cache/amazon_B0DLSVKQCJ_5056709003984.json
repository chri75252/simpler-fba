  "description": "Product Description Warm Tips – Patience is Key! Within 24 hours , the egg cracks open. By Day 3 , the unicorn begins to grow—keep it submerged to see it expand. By Day 5 , it can grow up to 600%! If water gets cloudy, replace it with fresh water (not exceeding 35°C). Unicorn shrinks back to original size if taken out of water for a few days. You can repeat the fun by soaking it again! Make it fun: Observe the egg’s daily changes with your child or turn it into a ‘mini science experiment’ to learn about water absorption!",
