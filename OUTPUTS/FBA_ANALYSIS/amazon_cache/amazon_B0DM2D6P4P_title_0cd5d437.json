While the core design, card backs, and set structure match those found in the US and other English-speaking regions, UK cards may occasionally feature region-specific promotional releases or special editions. For collectors, subtle differences in distribution, availability, and exclusive promos can influence the desirability and market value of UK cards compared to their international counterparts. Japanese Pokémon Cards Japanese Pokémon cards are renowned for their high print quality, glossy finish, and unique card backs that set them apart from international versions. They often feature exclusive artwork, special holofoil effects, and a wider range of rarities, such as Art Rares and Special Art Rares, which may not be available in English or Korean sets. Japanese sets are typically released earlier than their international counterparts, and certain cards—especially promos and limited editions—are only available in Japan, making them highly sought after by collectors worldwide. The use of Japanese language and distinct design elements adds to their authenticity and appeal for fans of the original Pokémon TCG experience. Korean Pokémon Cards Korean Pokémon cards offer a unique blend of features from both Japanese and English releases. They use Hangul script for card text and often combine cards from multiple Japanese or English sets within a single Korean set. Notably, Korean cards have historically used the English-style blue card back, but as of the Scarlet &amp; Violet era, they now feature the Japanese-style silver borders. The card stock and holo patterns can differ slightly from Japanese and English cards, and Korean sets are generally more affordable, making them popular among collectors seeking variety and value. Some exclusive promos and unique set compositions further distinguish Korean cards in the global market. TCYM Authenticated Pokemon Products The Importance of TCYM Authentication for Pokémon Cards To ensure the integrity of our products, TCYM sources Pokémon cards directly from reputable suppliers. By working with trusted partners across the globe, we eliminate risks associated with secondary markets or unauthorized sellers. Our direct sourcing approach includes: Osaka, Japan : Japan is home to some of the most exclusive trading card shops. We source Japanese Pokémon cards directly from a trusted shop in Osaka to ensure authenticity and secure handling. Seoul, Korea : South Korea’s official distributors provide us with Korean-language Pokémon products. By sourcing directly from these distributors in Seoul, we ensure that every pack or box is untampered. United Kingdom : For English-language Pokémon cards, we purchase exclusively through official UK distribution channels. This direct relationship ensures that all products arrive sealed and in excellent condition. Once shipments arrive at TCYM from our trusted suppliers, every booster pack, box set, or promotional item undergoes a rigorous inspection process focused on verifying its condition and ensuring it has not been tampered with. Our inspection process includes: Seal Integrity : We check that all seals on booster packs and boxes are intact and have not been resealed or compromised. Packaging Condition : Boxes are inspected for dents, tears, scratches, or other damage that could affect their collectible value. Authenticity Verification : While ensuring great condition is our priority, we also confirm that each product is genuine by examining printing quality, holographic features, set symbols, and codes.",
