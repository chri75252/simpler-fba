## 📋 PREPARATION PHASE

### Step 1: Environment Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backup project
cd "/mnt/c/Users/chris/Cloud-Drive_christianhaddad8@gmail.com/Cloud-Drive/Full/claude code/Amazon-FBA-Agent-System-v3-BACKUP-20250701_153247"

# Initialize git if needed and create parallel structure
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial backup state for parallel fixes"

# Create parallel development structure
mkdir -p .claude/commands specs trees
```

### Step 2: Custom Claude Commands Setup

#### `.claude/commands/init-parallel-fixes.md`

```md
# Initialize Parallel Development for Critical Fixes

You are setting up parallel development for critical hybrid processing fixes: $FEATURE_NAME with $NUM_AGENTS agents.

## Setup Process

1. **Create worktree branches and directories:**
   ```bash
   for i in $(seq 1 $NUM_AGENTS); do
     git worktree add -B $FEATURE_NAME-agent-$i trees/$FEATURE_NAME-agent-$i
   done
   ```

2. **Copy critical files to each worktree:**
   ```bash
   for i in $(seq 1 $NUM_AGENTS); do
     cp -r config/ trees/$FEATURE_NAME-agent-$i/ 2>/dev/null || true
     cp -r tools/ trees/$FEATURE_NAME-agent-$i/ 2>/dev/null || true
     cp -r utils/ trees/$FEATURE_NAME-agent-$i/ 2>/dev/null || true
     cp -r OUTPUTS/ trees/$FEATURE_NAME-agent-$i/ 2>/dev/null || true
     cp *.py trees/$FEATURE_NAME-agent-$i/ 2>/dev/null || true
   done
   ```

3. **Create agent coordination script:**
   ```bash
   cat > start-parallel-fixes.sh << EOF
#!/bin/bash
FEATURE_NAME="$FEATURE_NAME"
NUM_AGENTS=$NUM_AGENTS

echo "🚀 Starting $NUM_AGENTS parallel agents for critical fixes..."
for i in $(seq 1 $NUM_AGENTS); do
  echo "Starting Agent $i (Specialization: $(get_agent_specialization $i))"
  (cd trees/$FEATURE_NAME-agent-$i && claude --resume) &
done

wait
echo "✅ All agents completed. Run verification tests."
EOF
   chmod +x start-parallel-fixes.sh
   ```

Report completion with worktrees created and agent specializations assigned.
```
