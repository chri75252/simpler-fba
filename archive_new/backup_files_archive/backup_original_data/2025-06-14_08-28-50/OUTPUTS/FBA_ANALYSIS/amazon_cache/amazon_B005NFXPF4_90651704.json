  "description": "From the manufacturer Oil filters by MANN-FILTER - The best protection for your engine Protect your engine from damage! Why change your oil filter? During combustion, both dirt particles and combustion residues can penetrate into the engine oil. Without the appropriate oil filter to reliably keep these residues out of the engine oil, the engine can no longer be reliably supplied with clean engine oil and is thus no longer properly protected from wear. Not changing the filter at regular intervals risks reduced performance and increased oil consumption. In the worst case this can even lead to engine damage. Oil filters from MANN-FILTER protect! Consistent engine performance. Less wear. Oil filters from MANN-FILTER reliably clear oil circuits of contaminants and thus ensure consistently high engine performance. Thanks to outstanding dirt holding capacity, higher material durability, and the most modern filter media tailored for each vehicle model, oil filters from MANN-FILTER can produce fantastic results even under intense conditions and allow you extra long replacement intervals. Play it safe!
