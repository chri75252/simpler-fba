  "description": "Product Description When you have dry, rough, irritated skin you need something that will moisturise it and help it heal fast. In our Vaseline Intensive Care Essential Healing body lotion, we’ve combined healing micro-droplets of Vaseline Jelly with a fast-absorbing, non-greasy moisturising formula. The result is a lotion that moisturises to restore very dry skin, leaving it looking and feeling healthier. Our Essential Healing Intensive Care body lotion has been clinically proven to moisturise deeply** to soothe dry skin with the first application, and to keep it restored for 3 weeks*. Our skin is the barrier between our bodies and the outside world, and the health of our skin is essential to our overall wellbeing. At Vaseline, we believe that healthy skin starts with deep-restoring moisture, which is why our lotion's formula calms and soothes the skin. The micro-droplets of Vaseline Jelly penetrate deep down within the stratum corneum to form a protective layer on your skin and lock in moisture. This sealing barrier speeds up the skin’s natural barrier recovery. This Vaseline moisturiser offers you fast and effective body care and relief for dry, itchy skin, plus the confidence that it is suitable for sensitive skin. Apply Vaseline Intensive Care Essential Healing moisturising lotion to your skin daily to experience the rich yet quick-absorbing formula which restores the skin from deep within. *based on 4-week treatment clinical study **within stratum corneum Ingredients Aqua, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Isopropyl Myristate, Paraffinum Liquidum, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycol Stearate, Dimethicone, PEG-100 Stearate, Petrolatum, Cetyl Alcohol, Tapioca Starch, Phenoxyethanol, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Methylparaben, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Parfum, Sodium Hydroxide, Propylparaben, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Stearamide AMP, Lactic Acid, Avena Sativa Straw Extract, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Amyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Alcohol, Cinnamyl Alcohol, Citronellol, Coumarin, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool.
