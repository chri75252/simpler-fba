  "description": "Product Description Martingale Dog Collars Here's a gentle reminder: A dog collar is just a training aid. Relying solely on it to correct your dog's behavior won't work. Combine it with positive training, like rewarding and encouraging your dog. This helps your pet understand proper behaviors. Please measure your dog's neck size before ordering Martingale collars for large, medium and small dogs Selecting a collar of the appropriate size for your dog and adjusting it to fit your furry friend perfectly after receiving it is the very first and crucial step in proper collar-wearing. Determine the appropriate size: The measurement of the dog's neck is not the final size of the collar. A suitable collar should allow two fingers to be inserted between the collar and the dog's neck with ease. It should be approximately the neck circumference plus 1.5 to 2.5 inches.
