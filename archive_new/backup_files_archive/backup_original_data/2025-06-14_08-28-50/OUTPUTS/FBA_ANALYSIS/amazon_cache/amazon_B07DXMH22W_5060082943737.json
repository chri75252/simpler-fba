  "description": "From the manufacturer Creativity is one of the most powerful values of human beings. It stimulates our ability to express ourselves, learn and connect. The Talens brand offers all support products for art painting, graphic products and color materials. Talens Blockprint Talens Blockprint is a quick-dry opaque paint that has been specially developed for stencil and stamping techniques, such as woodcarving and linogravure (also known as block printing or woodprinting). Vivid colors are light resistant and can be diluted with water. Hands and utensils can be easily cleaned with soap and water after use. Talens Drawing Ink Versatile deep black drawing ink for making e.g. pen and ink drawings, watery drawings and covering large surfaces. Black drawing ink for drawing drawings, calligraphy and airbrush work. Made from very solid pigments and shellac. Its maximum pigmentation gives beautiful and intense results in black. Diluible in water. Once dry, it is resistant to it. Suitable for many types of surfaces, such as drawing paper (technical), cardboard, polyester film and tracing paper. Apply with watercolor brush or paintbrush. Talens Ecola Tempera The Talens Ecola tempera is a paint of great coloring power, specially developed to help you learn how to mix colors. The paints are opaque, easy to use and can be diluted with water, which means that hands and brushes can be easily cleaned with soap and water after use. Ecola is available in handy glass jars and larger flexible canisters. Talens watercolor Colour materials for painting and drawing, specially made for children, for use at home or at school. Products such as Panda, Wasco and Ecola, which can be used in many techniques. They can be applied separately or combined with each other. Talens Panda Oil Pies Talens Panda soft oil cakes are widely used by children, both at school and at home. Panda oil cakes transfer color easily and have paper wraps to protect hands from stains. These vivid colors can be used alone or in combination with various techniques, such as tempera, watercolor and the so-called repellency technique with Ecoline. Try adding Talens opaque black on top of Panda oil cakes and scratch the surface once the paint has dried to discover the colors below. School tempera talens Colour materials for painting and drawing, specially made for children, for use at home or at school. Products such as Panda, Wasco and Ecola, which can be used in many techniques. They can be applied separately or combined with each other. Talens Wasco wax cakes Talens Wasco wax cakes are widely used by children, both at school and at home. Thanks to their water-based formula, these waxes are hard enough not to break easily into children's hands, while still being soft enough to effortlessly transfer vivid colors. Paper wraps protect your hands from stains. These brightly colored waxes can be used alone or in combination with other techniques, such as Ecoline, for the so-called repellency technique. Try adding the Talens opaque black on top of the wax cakes and scratch the surface once the paint has dried to discover the colors below.
