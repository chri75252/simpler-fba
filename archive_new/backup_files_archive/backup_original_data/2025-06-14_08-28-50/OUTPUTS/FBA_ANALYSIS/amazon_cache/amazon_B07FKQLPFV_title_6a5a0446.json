    "STOP RATS FROM DRAINS - One of the primary ingress points for rats into a domestic or commercial property is via the drainage system, either directly from the main sewers or a collapse within the pipe. A drain guard is installed within the inspection chamber to stop rats.",
    "ONE-WAY FLAP PREVENTION - The Roshield drain guards allows liquids and solid waste to pass down the system whilst preventing access to rats moving upstream. The rats cannot pass or chew through the barrier flap, thus preventing their access to re-infest.",
    "EASY TO INSTALL PROTECTION - Drain guards require no previous experience with installation and, once installed, needs no long-term maintenance. Drain guards can be installed either at the entrance or exit of the pipe, and the included bolt can be switched to match the flow direction.",
    "MADE IN THE UK - Are drain guards are manufactured in the UK from 316 stainless steel (marine-grade) and are suitable for the challenging and damp environment found within a drainage system. Our drain guards are used within the professional pest control industry.",
    "DRAIN GUARD KIT SIZE - This listing is for a 4\" / 110mm version. The drain guard can be installed into 100mm Victorian drains. Instructions are included, and we also offer a support video and backup technical help on request. A 6\" / 150mm variant is also available."

  "description": "Product Description Roshield Drain Guards Available in 110mm (4\") or 150mm (6\") Professional build quality rodent drain flap to prevent rodent access to a properties main drainage system. It is estimated that, 90% of internal rat problems are caused by drainage defects and the Roshield Drain Guard is possibly the best proofing method to treat both active infestations as well prevent recurrence. The rat enter premises through the drainage defect such as a broken pipe and generally burrow through the ground until internal entry is gained into the building foundations, wall cavity and loft. The Roshield Drain Guard prevents rats from entering buildings via the sewer system, while allowing the free flow of waste in the other direction. It is important to note that additional care should be taken not to flush wet wipes and other solids not suitable for drainage Installation. Install the flap nearest to the boundary of the property or if you are aware of a drain collapse install it between the collapse and the property. Make sure that the flap is pointing down stream and if necessary swap the bolt over to the correct position. Fit the guard into the pipe making sure that the flap still has movement. An additional installation pole is available (not included) however the majority of installations can be fitted without this device 110mm / 4\" Drain guard Our 110mm version is the most popular for standard domestic drainage systems. They are simple to use and a popular and cost-effective solution for long-term rodent control. 150mm / 6\" Drain Guard Our 150mm version has been designed for larger drain pipes. Whilst not as common on domestic drainage systems that can often be found in or around blocks of flats or larger communal systems.",
