  "description": "Product Description Football is all that matters and it is the only thing in your mind and heart. Whether you show your passion for the game through singing, jumping, dancing – if you care about your team, you sweat. Sure Sport Cool for Men is an anti-perspirant deodorant that gives protection to those who live football. This aerosol spray combats sweat and odour for up to 48 hours so you can be confident that Sure is working when you need it most. Its unique minty-citrusy fragrance will keep you protected every minute of the game. It also contains Sure’s innovative MotionSense technology which works like this: unique microcapsules sit on the surface of your skin. When you move, friction breaks those microcapsules and they release more fragrance. The more you move, the more it protects. Whether you’re working hard in the office, playing hard out and about or just meeting up with friends, Sure Sport Cool will give you all the back-up you need. Sure, It won't let you down. How to use: Firstly, shake the deodorant can. Then hold it 15 centimetres away from your underarm and spray evenly in a well-ventilated area. Do not use on broken skin. Stop use if rash or irritation occurs. Avoid direct inhalation. Do not spray near eyes. Use only as directed. *ethyl alcohol Directions Firstly, shake the deodorant can.
