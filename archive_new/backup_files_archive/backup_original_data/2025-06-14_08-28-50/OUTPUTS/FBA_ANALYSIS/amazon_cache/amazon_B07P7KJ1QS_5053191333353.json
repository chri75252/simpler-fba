  "description": "Product Description Your baby's sensitive skin is very delicate and deserves a gentle clean, starting at the nappy change. Pampers Sensitive baby wipes care for your baby's sensitive skin in the kindest possible way thanks to their soft and thick fabric. The enzymes in pee and poo alter the skin's pH, increasing the risk of irritation and rash. Pampers Sensitive baby wipes contain unique formula that protects natural skin's pH better than cotton wool and water, so that even the most sensitive skin is cleaned and protected from skin irritation. Pampers Sensitive baby wipes are dermatologically approved by Skin Health Alliance dermatologists. Because Pampers Sensitive baby wipes are designed with the most sensitive baby skin in mind, they do not contain alcohol, perfume or dyes. Ingredients Aqua, Citric Acid, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sodium Benzoate, Sorbitan Caprylate, Sodium Citrate, Disodium EDTA, Isoamyl Laurate, Xanthan Gum Safety Warning Do not flush. Warning: To avoid danger of suffocation, keep outerwrapper and plastic bags away from babies and children. Do not place in cribs, beds, carriages or playpens. Dispose of outer wrapper immediately. Caution: This is not a toy. Do not allow children to push fingers or hand through opening. Manufacturer Contact Information Procter &amp; Gamble UK, Weybridge, Surrey, KT13 0XP See more",
