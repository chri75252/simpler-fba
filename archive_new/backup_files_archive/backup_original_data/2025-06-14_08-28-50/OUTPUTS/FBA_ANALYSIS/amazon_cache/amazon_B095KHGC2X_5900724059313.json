  "description": "Layup basketball balls are a good choice for all beginners who want to try their hand in basketball, have fun, but also for players who already have experience in this discipline. The shell of the ball is made of rubber, which provides a very good grip and a soft, quiet jump. The grained and embossed adhesive surface provides good control and a perfect touch experience - does not accidentally slip out, which is very important for a good pass during the game. Layup ball can be used both indoors and outdoors. It works great in regular basketball games, exercises with ball, control and basketball throwing training. But you don't have to be a professional to have a lot of fun with your friends on the usual course. To choose the right size, we recommend you read the size chart - individual balls vary in size and purpose for individual ages. The above Layup 4 is the perfect ball for children aged 4-10 years. Thanks to the expressive and attractive colours, basketball balls are ideal as a gift for a child. Basketball comes in a deflated condition, while needle and pump are not included. We recommend using a ball pump or compressor to inflate. Make sure the needle is lubricated with water or oil before use.",
