  "description": "Product Description BEESWAX WOOD POLISH. CLEANS, RESTORES, POLISHES &amp; PROTECTS Enhances the natural beauty of Oak, Pine, Beech and any other wooden surface or colour. Seals and protects for a perfect finish. NO SAFETY ISSUES This Beeswax furniture polish is: non toxic, biodegradable child, pet and kind to the environment. kitchen and food safe 100% NATURAL INGREDIENTS 100% Natural and Pure British Beeswax (Hand Poured in Wales) Triple filtered and sustainably sourced from BBKA approved bee farmers. RESTORE, CLEAN &amp; PROTECT Restore years of wax build up and dirt bringing dull furniture and floors back to life. Enhances the natural beauty of oak, pine, beech, hard woods &amp; much more. ETHICALLY SOURCED Our pure UK beeswax comes from bees that have been organically fed on forest, wildflower and gorse blossom from only the most natural hives for happy bees. EASY TO APPLY WITH FAST VISIBLE RESULTS STEP 1 PREPARE Ensure the surface is clean and dust free. STEP 2 APPLY Using a lint free cloth, apply the polish by rubbing into the wood surface following the direction of the grain. Additional coats can be applied for extra protection or if applying to bare wood STEP 3 BUFF Leave the polish on the surface for 5-10 minutes before buffing over with a cloth to restore the lustre. When properly protected, beeswax polish will cause liquids to bead up on the surface in the form of globules; a good indication of when the beeswax needs to be reapplied is when the liquids start to lie flat on the surface instead of beading up.
