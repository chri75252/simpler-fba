Our arm bands go through stringent safety checks. The testing company are independent from Limmys, and they follow all safety regulations issued by the EU, USA, and UK authorities. Certificates are only issued when all safety requirements are met. Why are Limmys designs different to others? Limmys is a forever evolving brand. We like to offer unique designs to our customers that are not otherwise available on the market. Being different gives our customers more choice. Why did Limmys choose these colours? The colours that we use have been specifically chosen to ensure that the wearer is visible when in the water. This makes the wearer easy to identify and enhances safety. What benefits do the arm bands give? The arm bands are an aid for kids who are learning to swim. They allow the wearer to improve their strokes and feel more confident in the water. A parent or guardian should be with young children at all times while they are learning to swim. Why should I choose the Limmys brand? Limmys is a premium brand whereby our primary focus is on quality, safety, and our customers. We know that the satisfaction of our customers is the key to building our brand, so no expense is spared when providing the best customer experience. LIMMYS ARM BANDS COLLECTION",
