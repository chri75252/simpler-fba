  "description": "Product Description Patterns Introduction Shower : Simulating rainwater droplets. It is well known that plants prefer natural rainwater, but rainwater cannot always be present. Showers in hose pipe spray guns can compensate for this. Mist &amp; Cone: Mist is mild atomization, while Cone is mass atomization. Flowers and seedlings require soft water mist to replenish moisture, which can prevent damage to plants and the soil near roots. Jet &amp; Full &amp; Center &amp; Flat： Four types of strong water splashes in different shapes meet various washing needs, such as car washing, soil washing, crevice washing, etc. Selection of different lengths Garden Hose Water Spray Lance Water Spray Lance Length Hose Pipe Spray Gun Length Water Spray Lance (Fixed length 48cm) Length Water Spray Lance (Scalable length 95~155cm) Spray nozzle adjustment angle / Spray nozzle adjustment angle 0~180° Spray nozzle adjustment angle 0~180° Usage scenario Flower pots/ Lawns/ On the ground Usage scenario Flower rack/ Bottom of car/ Inner side of tire Usage scenario Plants hanging from high places Built for Durability and Comfort RESTMO Heavy-duty Garden Hose Pipe Spray Gun Providing an ideal combination of comfort and durability, this garden hose spray gun is built with premium zinc-alloy metal material.
