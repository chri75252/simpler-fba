Why disinfect? Disinfecting animal habitats and veterinary settings are essential for reducing the spread of diseases, and protecting animals and humans from infection. Disinfectant products are used to rid surfaces and items of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microscopic organisms that could put animal health at risk. Regular use of disinfectants in professional or home settings can help keep our animal companions safe and healthy by drastically reducing the risk of infection and cross-contamination. Furthermore, custodial staff members in veterinary settings must use a disinfectant which has been tested to veterinary protocols, to ensure it is suitable for animal environments. Cleaning and disinfecting cages, kennels, operating theatres and other areas that may come into contact with animals undergoing medical care, is essential to ensure all pathogens are removed Ingredients Didecyldimethylammonium Chloride 17.48g/kg, Alkyl (C12-16) Dimethylbenzyl Ammonium Chloride 17.48g/kg, N-(3-Aminopropyl)-N-dodecylpropane-1, 3-diamine 14.99g/kg.
