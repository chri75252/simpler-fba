  "description": "Product Description Are fruit plants easy to grow and maintain? Yes, most are beginner-friendly. They need sun, water, and occasional feeding. Berries are especially easy and low-maintenance. How are fruit plants delivered? Plants are sent potted or bare-root, depending on season. All are securely packed and have planting instructions in the listing. When will my plant produce fruit? Most fruit plants crop in summer to autumn. Exact timing depends on variety – check listings for harvest seasons. Do fruit plants need full sun? Most do best in full sun (6+ hrs/day), though some like currants and gooseberries can tolerate partial shade. Are fruit plants suitable for growing in the UK climate? Yes, many fruit plants are hardy and bred to thrive in UK weather, including apples, berries, plums, figs and more.",
