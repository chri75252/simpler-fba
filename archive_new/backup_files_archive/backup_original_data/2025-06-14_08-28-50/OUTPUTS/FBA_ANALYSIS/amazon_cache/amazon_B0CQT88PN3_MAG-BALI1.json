Slight warming during wireless charging is normal, especially under heavy use. The product's metal build enhances heat dissipation for efficient charging, which may result in a warmer feel. Can Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station (Foldable 3-in-1) charge an Apple Watch Ultra? Yes, Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station can charge Apple Watch models, including the Apple Watch Ultra. Due to Ultra's larger size, adjust the watch module's angle for a secure connection, especially if the phone charging module is not in use. Is this charging pad compatible with Android phones? Not compatible with Android. The charging pad is designed for devices with magnetic wireless charging, available only in iPhone 12 and later models. For optimal Qi2 15W charging, the device must be an iPhone 13 or newer, running on iOS 17.2 or later. Can a phone case affect wireless charging? For the best wireless charging experience, we recommend using Apple's official magnetic phone cases. You should avoid cases thicker than 2.5 mm and non-magnetic cases, as they may affect charging efficiency. Why doesn't my iPhone show the charging circle when using magnetic charging? Firstly, verify if your iPhone is a model from the 13/14/15 series, as only these models support magnetic charging. Next, ensure that your phone's operating system is updated to iOS 17.2, as this is necessary for the feature to function properly.
