Always read the label and follow usage instructions.o3 What makes easy Seriously Thick Bleach “seriously” thick? Engineered with a high-viscosity gel that clings to vertical and hard-to-reach areas—like under toilet rims and grout lines—so it works longer and penetrates deeper before you rinse. Does it really kill 99.9 % of germs? Yes. Independent lab tests confirm it eliminates 99.9 % of common bacteria, viruses and fungi when used as directed, giving you hospital-grade hygiene at home. Can I use it in a hard-water area? Absolutely. The formula includes water-softening agents that break down limescale and mineral deposits, so you still get a sparkling, streak-free finish. Will it damage coloured fabrics or grout? It’s a powerful bleach, so keep it away from coloured fabrics and unsealed grout. For colour-safe cleaning, spot-test an inconspicuous area first. How long should I leave it on a surface? For everyday disinfection, allow 3–5 minutes before rinsing. For heavy stains (mould, mildew, limescale), leave up to 15 minutes for maximum effect.",
