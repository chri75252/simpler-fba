How Does the Adaptive Left and Right Channels Work? The adaptive left and right channels can only be completed inside the charging case. When placing the earbuds into the case, there’s no need to distinguish between left and right; just insert them as they are. However, once you remove the earbuds from the case, you must use them according to their designated sides: the one from the left side of the case is for the left ear, and the one from the right side is for the right ear.

How to Use the Multi-Point Connection Feature? With multi-point connection, follow these tips to ensure a stable connection and smooth device switching: 1. Minimize Signal Interference: If the earphones are connected to multiple devices simultaneously, signal interference may occur. It’s recommended to turn off the Bluetooth function on any unused devices. 2. Manage Power Consumption: Multi-point connection mode consumes more power than single-point connection. Ensure the earphones and devices are fully charged before use. The video showcases the product in use. The video guides you through product setup. The video compares multiple products.

How to Adjust the Tightness of Your Headphones? Adjust the angle of the ear clips as needed. If the ear clip is too tight, gently pinch the ends of the clip, then carefully pull outward to widen the gap. If the ear clip is too loose, gently pinch the ends of the clip, then carefully press inward with a crossing motion to narrow the gap. If the angles of the ear clips on the left and right sides differ significantly, pull outward to widen the gap slightly more. Then, press inward gently with a crossing motion to make the clip smaller. The video showcases the product in use. The video guides you through product setup. The video compares multiple products.
