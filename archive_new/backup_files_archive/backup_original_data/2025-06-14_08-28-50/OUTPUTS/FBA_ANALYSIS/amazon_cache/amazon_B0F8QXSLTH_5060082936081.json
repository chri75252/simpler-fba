  "description": "From the Publisher Why did I create this book? All the images within this beautiful colouring book were created by hand with no AI or image generator involvement. This is what makes this colouring book unique as all the images had to be thought out using my imagination and then drawn out. I always had a passion for drawing and this passion was re-ignited when I had my first child. When my son, who was 5 years old at the time was bored, I would get out some plain paper and draw images. I would then give them to him to colour in. He would cut the images out, put them on a large paper and stick it on his bedroom wall. This later inspired me to share my creations with the world. To make these images I first thought of what everyone would find familiar and enjoyable , so I set about drawing the images on a tablet. I had to re-draw some of the images many times, especially the ear. Some images are not perfect, for example the earth image is not completely round but that is because it was done by hand and not the computer, so i guess that makes it more personal to you. I hope you enjoy this colouring book as much as I enjoyed creating it. I also hope it inspires you to create your own pictures or encourage others to do so. Key Features Unique! All the images in this colouring book are unique and can not be found anywhere else. They have all been drawn by hand, meaning this book has been created with care and thought, rather than just using AI. Bold! Dark bold lines that sharpen the image to enhance the colouring experience. Excellent in helping to focus the mind by trying to colour within the lines. Bold sharp lines help with contrasting between the image and the paper. Educational! Familiar images from the real world be it animals, objects, food and vehcile, all help educate the mind. Each image has the name of what it represents which encourages learning and focus. Relaxing! Simple and sweet to the eye the images within this colouring book help to promote relaxation and calmness. Pick up your favourite colour and unwind as you fill in the image, use your imagination to create a background and let the colours flow. You will feel like you have meditated as calmness flows through your mind and soul. Sample of the unique hand drawn images within the book Each Image is printed on its own page with no other image behind the page. This ensures that when you are finished with your masterpiece it can be cut out of the book and put on display for all to see. There are over 100+ images with a large variety of themes be it animals, food, vehicles, objects and the alphabet. As each of them were drawn by hand, you will not come across another colouring book like this. Start your journey into colouring and see how fulfilling, relaxing, motivating and fun it is to do!",
