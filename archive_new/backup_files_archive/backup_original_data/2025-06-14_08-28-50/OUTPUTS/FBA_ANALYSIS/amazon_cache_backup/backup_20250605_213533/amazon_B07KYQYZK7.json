    "9-Inch Large Coal Shovel – Whether you use it with open fires for collecting coals and ashes, or you need a hand shovel for scooping coals for your back-garden barbeque, this 9-inch-wide heat resistant ash shovel will effectively do the job!",
    "Heavy-duty Coal Shovel Metal Pressed Head – Thick steel sheets are pressed into shape, with added ridges to reinforce this fire shovel. It is then finished with flared edges, and black paint to protect and prolong the life of the coal shovel heavy duty.",
    "Wooden Handle – Comes with a smoothed and shaped handle so no nasty splinters. The metal shovel with wooden handle is easy-to-grip, and won't transfer heat as a metal handle does. The metal hand shovel also features a universal attachment. The handle is detachable and replaceable via double rivets so you can put a longer handle any time.",
    "Multi-purpose Metal Shovel – Being resistant to heat and wear, this hand shovel heavy duty is ideal to use on hot surfaces such as on the fireplaces. But the flexible design makes it also usable as a metal dustpan garden shovel to collect grass cuttings, sands, or other debris in your yards.",
    "Leading Brand – Designed by The Dustpan and Brush Store with the end-user in mind!"
