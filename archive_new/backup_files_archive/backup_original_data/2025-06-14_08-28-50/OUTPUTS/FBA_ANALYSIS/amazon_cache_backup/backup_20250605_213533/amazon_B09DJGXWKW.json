  "description": "Product Description How long does a Benebone last? In a few weeks, maybe a month, it’s usually time to retire. It varies from one dog to the next, so keep a close eye out for wear and tear. If you’re handy, try smoothing gnarly spots with a wood file or heavy grit sandpaper to prolong life. Are Benebones edible? Benebones have just the right amount of tantalising flavour to enhance your pup’s chewing experience. Our bones are made for a good chew session, but are not edible treats to be consumed. Watch for signs of wear and replace when necessary! Which size is best for my pup? We’ve got you covered with tiny bones for cute little 15-pounders, Giant bones for hundred-pounders and everything in between. If your pup is between sizes or an enthusiastic chewer, consider sizing up. Your pup will thank you! What are the ingredients? Benebones are made with USA-sourced nylon and flavoured with a variety of real ingredients like yummy bacon, chicken, peanut, beef tripe, maple wood and jack salmon. What’s different about a puppy Benebone? Our puppy Benebones are a tad softer for puppies without all their adult teeth just yet. Once your dog has adult teeth, it’s time to move on to our regular chews",
