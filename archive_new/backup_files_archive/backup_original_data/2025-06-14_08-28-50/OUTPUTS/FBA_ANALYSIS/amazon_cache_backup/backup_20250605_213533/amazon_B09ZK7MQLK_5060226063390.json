  "description": "Product Description Convenience Anywhere &amp; Anytime ____________________________ Perfect for road trips, hiking, camping, around the home and more. Take it with you anywhere! Designed to be easy to use and easy to carry, Bonza's Collapsible Dog Bowl is your new favorite travel companion. Available in two sizes, they hold plenty of food or water, and the handy carabiner and bottle holder makes water easily accessible when you're on-the-go! Two Practical Sizes ________________ No more constantly stopping to refill or having collapsible bowls they can't fit their head in. Bonza bowls are designed to hold a lot of water and are even wide enough for two dogs to drink or eat from at the same time. The large size holds up to 1.2L and is perfect for medium to large dogs over 23Kg. The Extra Large size holds a massive 1.6L and with an opening of almost 20.3cm, it's perfect for the largest of breeds over 45Kg and those with wide snouts. HANDY WATER BOTTLE HOLDER Keeps bowl and water together. Need a drink stop? Their water and bowl is always readily available. Simply slip the silicone holder over any standard size water bottle and clip onto your bag or day pack. EASY TO ADJUST Adjusts to suit your needs. If they just want a little water, you can expand just half way. Ideal when enjoying shorter walks and provides added stability. Expand completely for the largest serving size then when they are done, collapse flat and the bowl takes up virtually no room. 100% DISHWASHER SAFE Pop into the dishwasher for an easy clean. The bowl, water bottle holder and the carabiner clip are 100% dishwasher safe. You can rinse and clean under the faucet using warm soapy water too. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS Q: Does the bowl stay open and popped up when a dog is snuffling around in it and shoving it around? A: Yes, the bowl is designed to be very sturdy and not collapse if bumped or knocked. Q: Should I be worried about the bowl ripping or tearing at the seams? A: The bowl has been improved with harder silicone and more stringent quality control. Tearing is very unlikely with general use. Q: How does the bottle holder actually work? A: The bone-shaped bottle holder will slip securely over any standard size water bottle. Once attached, you can then clip the bottle holder and the bowl directly to your bag or pack. Q: Is the bowl 100% dishwasher safe? A: Yes, and we recommend washing before first use. The carabiner and water bottle holder can also be washed in the dishwasher. Q: Is the bowl heat and cold resistant? A: Yes, the bowl can withstand temperatures from -40F (-40C) to 446F (230C) so it's perfect for your food too. Q: Is this BPA free and food-grade silicone? A: Yes, the bowl is food-grade and 100% BPA free. Q: Is the silicone odourless? A: Yes, there may be some initial odor from manufacturing and handling. We highly recommend washing before the first use. ABOUT BONZA Bonza’s goal is to make life easier for pet owners everywhere. Simplify your lifestyle so you can spend more time enjoying your four-legged companion. We will only ever provide you with superior manufacturing and use the best materials possible for all Bonza products.",
