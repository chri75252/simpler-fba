  "description": "Product Description Don’t settle for less than an uninterrupted night's sleep with up to 12h protection. Always Ultra Secure Night Extra (Size 5) sanitary towels with wings come with absorbent &amp; gentle feel top layer. They are designed with 3 protection features so that you don’t wake up to check for leaks or change your pad halfway through the night. A 9 Percent larger front and 85 Percent larger back (vs. Always Ultra Normal size 1), paired with our LeakGuard technology ensure all-around coverage to prevent leaks and Odourlock technology neutralises odours during period nights. Always Ultra pads are dermatologically approved by the Skin Health Alliance. Directions 1. Remove the sanitary towel from its packaging. 2. Align the adhesive strip on the back of the sanitary towel with your underwear. 3. Press the sanitary towel firmly against your underwear to ensure it stays in place. 4. Dispose of the used sanitary towel properly in a waste bin. 5. Replace the sanitary towel with a new one as needed.
