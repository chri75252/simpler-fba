It is thus ideal for applications such as flashlights, toys, modelling, game consoles, digital cameras, flash equipment, medical equipment etc. maxE has the energy to power all your devices. The self-discharge is 10 times lower than in regular NiMH batteries. After a year, there is still around 80% of the initial capacity left. This was made possible by a special separator which dramatically reduces unwanted internal current flow. Benefits the environment and your wallet NiMH batteries can generally be used wherever disposable batteries are used. This allows you to save money and protect the environment. A rechargeable battery can replace many hundreds to thousands of batteries! Fast charging + no memory effect The batteries can be charged with a high charging current, thereby very short charging times are possible. With the latest battery technology, the memory effect is ruled out even after several partial charges. What is maxE? The self-discharge is 10 times lower than in normal NiMH batteries. After one year they still retain up 95% of the initial capacity. This is made possible by a special insultator which dramatically reduces the unwanted internal current flow. As the batteries are supplied pre-charged, they can be used immediately. Economical and benefits the environment Sustainable from beginning to end Ideal for power intensive applications ANSMANN Portable Power Solutions Primary and Rechargeable Batteries Coin Cells and Camera Batteries Power banks and Battery Chargers Torches, Headlights and LED Floodlights Travel Adaptors and Power Supplies",
