Key points influencing this recommendation:
- Supplier discovery has not been completed, which is essential to ensure reliable sourcing and cost-effectiveness.
- Products have not been extracted, meaning the product data is incomplete or unavailable for further evaluation.
- Although financial analysis and automation setup are done, the presence of 2 errors indicates potential issues that need addressing before moving forward.

**Next steps:**
1. Resolve the errors encountered during the analysis.
2. Complete supplier discovery to verify sourcing options.
3. Extract and review product data thoroughly.
4. Reassess the opportunity once all data is complete and error-free.

Proceeding without these steps could lead to unforeseen risks and inefficiencies.",2025-06-28T04:25:09.253265
