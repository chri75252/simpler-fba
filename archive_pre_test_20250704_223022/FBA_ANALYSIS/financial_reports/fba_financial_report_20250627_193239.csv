- Amazon data and supplier discovery are completed, which is positive.
- Products extraction was not completed, which means detailed product-level data is missing.
- Financial analysis and automation setup are done, indicating readiness on those fronts.
- However, there was 1 error encountered during the process.

**Recommendation:**

Before proceeding with this product opportunity, it is important to address the missing product extraction step and investigate the error encountered. Without detailed product data, the financial analysis may not be fully reliable. I recommend resolving the error, completing the product extraction, and then re-evaluating the opportunity to ensure all critical data points are accurate and complete. Proceeding without this could increase risk.",2025-06-27T19:32:39.389181
