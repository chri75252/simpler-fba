- Amazon data and supplier discovery are completed, indicating good initial research.
- Products were not extracted, which means detailed product-level data is missing.
- Financial analysis and automation setup are completed, showing readiness on those fronts.
- However, there was 1 error encountered, and the absence of product extraction is a significant gap.

**Recommendation:**  
Do not proceed with this product opportunity until the product extraction step is successfully completed and the error is resolved. Without detailed product data, it is difficult to accurately assess the viability and profitability of the opportunity. Address the error, ensure product data is extracted, and then re-evaluate before making a decision.",2025-06-27T20:07:10.479670
