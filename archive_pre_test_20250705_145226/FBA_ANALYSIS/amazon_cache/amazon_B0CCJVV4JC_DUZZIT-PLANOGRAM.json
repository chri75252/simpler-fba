  "description": "Spontex Microfibre Collection Cloths are super efficient and long lasting multipurpose cloths. They can be machine washed up to 500 times and used wet or dry for most cleaning tasks around the house including wiping down, dusting and even washing dishes. These multipurpose cloths are very efficient even without detergent removing dirt, grease, bacteria and even viruses* with just water**. Cloth size approx.: 30 x 30 cm. Spontex Microfibre cloths are made up of thousands of tiny fibres, so the number of contact points with the surface is greatly increased compared to non microfibre cloths. This means that each cloth has extraordinary cleaning power that eliminates 99% of bacteria and viruses*. Our Microfibre cloths can be used with just water to clean efficiently and achieve sparkling results, there's no need to use cleaning detergents which may pollute streams and rivers. They are also super resistant and long lasting. They can be washed in the washing machine not once, but up to 500 times, so you can keep using your cloths over and over again. When they are no longer fit for their intended use why not find them a new purpose like cleaning shoes or wiping down your bins. Top Tip: These cloths come in a variety of colours so why not use a specific colour for a specific task or room all around the house. Why not try blue for the loo and pink for the sink? * Removes 99% of E. Coli bacteria from glass surfaces and human coronavirus from tiled surfaces with water only. Tested by an independent laboratory.",
