  "description": "Product Description Spring Season It can raise the soil temperature; Increases tree nutrient storage; Prevents breeding activities of pests and reduces the incidence of orchard pests and diseases. Summer Season Minimise the growth of weeds around the plant and ensures that water and mineral nutrients are absorbed from the soil and supplied to the plant, thus ensuring its growth. Autumn Season It can raise the soil temperature; Increases tree nutrient storage; Prevents breeding activities of pests and reduces the incidence of orchard pests and diseases. Winter Season It can make it difficult for cold winds to intrude and reduce water loss through evaporation; Reducing the thickness of the permafrost layer increases the ground temperature and reduces and prevents root damage. There are two types of geotextiles for weed control: The weed fleece (A) is often used in gardening and landscaping or agriculture. It has a significantly lower water permeability. The advantage is a slower penetration of the water into the soil, but conversely this means a slower escape (evaporation) of the water out of the soil. After laying the weed fleece, we recommend that you first thoroughly water it to improve the water permeability. You will find after repeated rain and watering that the water permeability will settle. It is important to consider other factors, for example the soil type, the degree of 'preloading' with weeds, or how the fleece is 'embedded', the material you work with e.g. gravel. If the ground below is too dense, then the water will also slow down. With weed/ribbon tissue (B), water seepage is significantly faster, but with less water storage. Therefore, the fabric (B) is used rather as an additional weed barrier under opaque gravel paths, gravel paths or wooden decks. Please note Please note: Weed membranes in widths of 2m\\3m\\4m are folded and rolled up.
