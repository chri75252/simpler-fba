    "MASSIVE UPGRADE FROM TRADITIONAL MICROFIBRE CLOTH - Whilst everyone has a bundle of, thin, flimsy microfiber cloth —brightly coloured, sold in bulk, they’re almost an afterthought. But some of us don’t settle for just an attractive price —we want quality. At Towelogy, we don’t cut corners. We offer you microfibre cleaning cloth that feel different, perform better, and last longer—Feel the Upgrade.",
    "HIGHLY EFFICIENT MICROFIBRE CLEANING CLOTH - More absorbent, more effective—our microfiber cloths trap dust, dirt, and spills in seconds without leaving streaks or lint behind. Whether you’re wiping down kitchen surfaces, polishing glass, or detailing your car, experience a streak-free shine with minimal effort. Perfect multipack rags for cleaning.",
    "ULTRA THICK & DURABLE - Our premium 420GSM microfibre cloths multipack are ultra thick, ultra soft, and built to last through countless washes.

    "EXTRA LARGE MICROFIBRE CLOTHS - Bigger means better cleaning in less time. At 40x40cm, these oversized microfiber cloths cleaning cover more surface area with each wipe, making every cleaning job quicker, easier, and more efficient. Cover more surface area and get the jobs you dreaded done like never before.",
    "SAVE MONEY IN THE LONG RUN - Why keep buying packs of disposable paper towels or low-quality cloths that fray and fall apart? Invest in quality once, and clean better for years. Machine washable and reusable, our lint free cloth help you cut waste, save money, and get a better clean—every single time. Micro Fiber Cloth for Cleaning Glasses, Mirrors, TV, Monitor, Screen, Bathroom, Kitchen and overall Household."
