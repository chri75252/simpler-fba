
# Amazon FBA Agent System v3 – Session Continuity & Troubleshooting Handoff

## 1. Session Overview

**Primary Goal:**  
To validate, troubleshoot, and document the cache integration and output file generation logic in the Amazon FBA Agent System v3, specifically focusing on the correct behavior of the cache-clearing mechanisms (`clear_cache` and `selective_cache_clear`), AI category suggestion, and output file creation for supplier scraping, Amazon analysis, linking maps, and FBA financial calculations.

**Key Objectives:**
- Ensure that all output files (supplier cache, Amazon analyzed products, linking map, AI category cache, FBA financial report) are generated as expected for each test scenario.
- Validate that cache-clearing settings (`clear_cache`, `selective_cache_clear`) behave exactly as specified in the system configuration.
- Confirm that AI category suggestion logic is triggered and produces unique, non-duplicated results across test runs.
- Provide a complete, step-by-step record of all actions, issues, and system states for future troubleshooting and session continuation.

## 2. Chronological Problem Log

### **Initial Issues Identified**
- **Cache Integration:**  
  - The main workflow (`tools/passive_extraction_workflow_latest.py`) was not respecting the `CacheManager` logic or the `clear_cache`/`selective_cache_clear` settings in `config/system_config.json`.
  - The FBA Financial Calculator was not running or generating output files as expected.

- **Output File Generation:**  
  - Expected output files (supplier scraped products, Amazon analyzed products, linking map, AI category cache, FBA financial report) were missing or not updated after workflow runs.

### **Key Error Messages & Symptoms**
- Output files referenced in logs (e.g., `fba_summary_clearance-king_co_uk_20250530_165605.json`, `fba_financial_report_20250530_170011.csv`) were not found in the expected directories.
- AI category suggestion step failed with:  
  `ERROR - AI JSON invalid → "AI JSON missing keys: {'skip_urls', 'top_3_urls', 'secondary_urls'}"`
- Linking map (`OUTPUTS/FBA_ANALYSIS/Linking map/linking_map.json`) was not updated after workflow runs.
- FBA financial report was not generated or not found in the expected output directory.
- Log files (e.g., `fba_extraction_20250530.log`) were empty after workflow runs.

### **Attempted Solutions & Outcomes**
- **CacheManager Integration:**  
  - Refactored workflow logic to ensure `CacheManager` is initialized and invoked according to the four possible combinations of `clear_cache` and `selective_cache_clear`.
  - Ensured that selective cache clearing triggers AI category progression as required.

- **Output File Verification:**  
  - Systematically listed and read every output file after each test run.
  - Verified the content of each file (supplier cache, Amazon cache, linking map, AI category cache, FBA financial report).
  - Identified that some files were not being created due to bugs in file path handling or workflow logic.

- **Bug Fixes:**  
  - Fixed a bug where `workflow_instance` was referenced instead of `self` in the `run()` method, which prevented the FBA Financial Calculator from running.
  - Ensured that all output directories are created with `os.makedirs(..., exist_ok=True)` before file writes.
  - Adjusted file path handling to ensure output files are written to the correct directories.

- **Test Execution:**  
  - Ran Test 1 (`clear_cache=false`, `selective_cache_clear=false`) and Test 2 (`clear_cache=false`, `selective_cache_clear=true`) after clearing all relevant cache and AI suggestion files.
  - After each test, listed every output file, opened and read their contents, and compared them to expected results.

- **Diagnostics:**  
  - Used PowerShell and Python commands to list, delete, and verify files in all relevant output directories.
  - Checked for file creation in both relative and absolute paths to account for possible path misconfigurations.

## 3. Current Technical State

### **Scripts and Their Current Versions**
- **Main Workflow:**  
  - `tools/passive_extraction_workflow_latest.py`  
    - Fully integrated with `CacheManager`.
    - Contains logic for all four cache-clearing scenarios.
    - Calls FBA Financial Calculator at the end of each run.
    - Handles AI category suggestion and state file management.

- **Cache Manager:**  
  - `tools/cache_manager.py`  
    - Provides `clear_cache(strategy=...)` with strategies: `smart_selective`, `size_based`, etc.

- **FBA Financial Calculator:**  
  - `tools/FBA_Financial_calculator.py`  
    - Exposes `run_calculations()` for generating financial reports.

### **Output Files and Their State (After Last Test 1 Run)**
- **Supplier Scraped Products:**  
  - `OUTPUTS/cached_products/clearance-king_co_uk_products_cache.json`  
    - Contains 40 products (verified by reading file).
    - Each product has fields: `title`, `price`, `url`, `image_url`, `ean`, etc.

- **Amazon Analyzed Products:**  
  - `OUTPUTS/FBA_ANALYSIS/amazon_cache/`  
    - No new files created for the last run (possible bug or no matches found).

- **Linking Map:**  
  - `OUTPUTS/FBA_ANALYSIS/Linking map/linking_map.json`  
    - Not updated after last run; still contains old entries.

- **AI Category Cache:**  
  - `OUTPUTS/FBA_ANALYSIS/ai_category_cache/`  
    - No new files created after last run (AI suggestion step failed due to missing keys in AI JSON).

- **FBA Financial Report:**  
  - `C:\Users\chris\Amazon-FBA-Agent-System\OUTPUTS\FBA_ANALYSIS\fba_financial_report_20250530_170011.csv`  
    - File exists in absolute path, but not accessible via relative workspace tools.

- **Workflow Summary:**  
  - `OUTPUTS/FBA_ANALYSIS/fba_summary_clearance-king_co_uk_20250530_165903.json`  
    - Not found in expected directory after last run.

- **State File:**  
  - `OUTPUTS/FBA_ANALYSIS/clearance-king_co_uk_processing_state.json`  
    - Not found after last run (may not have been created due to workflow errors).

### **Expected Output Files (Per README and Workflow Spec)**
- `OUTPUTS/cached_products/clearance-king_co_uk_products_cache.json`
- `OUTPUTS/FBA_ANALYSIS/amazon_cache/amazon_<ASIN>.json`
- `OUTPUTS/FBA_ANALYSIS/Linking map/linking_map.json`
- `OUTPUTS/FBA_ANALYSIS/ai_category_cache/<supplier>_categories_<timestamp>.json`

- `OUTPUTS/FBA_ANALYSIS/<supplier>_processing_state.json`

### **System Configurations and Settings**
- `config/system_config.json` (current state for Test 1):  
  ```json

      "clear_cache": false,
      "selective_cache_clear": false,
      ...
