
## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps

### **Unresolved Issues**
- **AI Category Suggestion Fails:**  
  - AI JSON returned by OpenAI is missing required keys (`'skip_urls'`, `'top_3_urls'`, `'secondary_urls'`), causing the AI suggestion step to fail and no AI category cache file to be created.
- **Linking Map Not Updated:**  
  - `linking_map.json` is not updated after workflow runs, indicating a possible bug in the linking map update logic or in the product matching process.
- **Amazon Analyzed Products Not Cached:**  
  - No new files in `amazon_cache/` after workflow runs, possibly due to no matches or a bug in the caching logic.
- **FBA Financial Report Path Issues:**  
  - FBA financial report is created in an absolute path, which may not be accessible from the relative workspace, causing confusion in file discovery.
- **Workflow Summary File Missing:**  
  - `fba_summary_<supplier>_<timestamp>.json` is not found after workflow runs, possibly due to a bug in the summary file writing logic.
- **State File Not Created:**  
  - `clearance-king_co_uk_processing_state.json` is not found after workflow runs, possibly due to workflow errors or early termination.

### **Next Troubleshooting Steps**
1. **Fix AI Category Suggestion:**  
   - Debug the `_get_ai_suggested_categories_enhanced` method to ensure the AI response includes all required keys.
   - Add fallback logic or stricter validation to prevent workflow failure if AI response is malformed.

2. **Verify Linking Map Update Logic:**  
   - Trace the code path for updating and saving `linking_map.json` to ensure it is called after each product analysis.

3. **Check Amazon Cache File Creation:**  
   - Ensure that Amazon analyzed products are being cached correctly in `amazon_cache/` for each processed product.

4. **Standardize Output File Paths:**  
   - Refactor file writing logic to use consistent, relative paths for all output files.

5. **Ensure Workflow Summary and State Files Are Written:**  
   - Add error handling and logging to confirm that summary and state files are always written, even if no profitable products are found.

6. **Re-run Tests After Fixes:**  
   - After addressing the above issues, re-run Test 1 and Test 2, and verify that all expected output files are created and contain the correct data.

## 5. Critical Context & Constraints

- **Strict Output Verification:**  
  - After each test, every output file must be listed, opened, and its contents verified for correctness and completeness.
  - No assumptions are to be made based on logs alone; file system state is the source of truth.

- **Cache-Clearing Behavior:**  
  - `clear_cache=false`, `selective_cache_clear=false`: No cache clearing; all caches and AI suggestions should be preserved.
  - `clear_cache=false`, `selective_cache_clear=true`: Only non-analyzed supplier products should be cleared; analyzed data (linking map, Amazon cache, etc.) must be preserved; AI scraping must be triggered.
  - Each test must start with a clean state (all relevant caches and AI suggestion files cleared).

- **AI Category Suggestion:**  
  - There must be two unique AI category suggestion files after running both Test 1 and Test 2, with no duplication of suggested categories/pages.

- **FBA Financial Calculator:**  
  - The FBA financial report must be generated and saved in the correct output directory after each workflow run.

- **Documentation & Record-Keeping:**  
  - Every action, file, and outcome must be documented in detail for session continuity.
