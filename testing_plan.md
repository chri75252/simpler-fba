# MASTER PLAN FOR MULTI-AGENT TESTING

## GLOBAL CONTEXT
- **Project root**: C:\Users\chris\Desktop\Amazon-FBA-Agent-System-v32
- **Workflow & outputs**: docs\README.md
- **Toggle definitions**: config\system-config-toggle-v2.md
- **Golden reference log**: logs\debug\run_custom_poundwholesale_20250712_092246.log
- **Crash snippet**: (see "REFERENCE ERROR" section at bottom)

## WHY MULTI-WORKTREE?
Allows parallel agent runs (prep, exec, debug) that share the same .git object store but keep code & logs isolated. Quick rollback and no massive folder copies.

### INITIAL WORKTREES (run once):
```bash
git worktree add ../Amazon-FBA-Agent-System-v32-prep  -b prep-run
git worktree add ../Amazon-FBA-Agent-System-v32-test  -b test-run
git worktree add ../Amazon-FBA-Agent-System-v32-debug -b debug-run
```

Each agent below operates ONLY inside its own worktree.

---

## STRICT RULES (NO EXCEPTIONS)
1. Delete only files listed in docs\README.md (state & cache cleanup section).
2. Never delete OUTPUTS\FBA_ANALYSIS\amazon_cache or any folders.
3. No artificial timeouts; wait for natural finish or crash.
4. After every run, catalogue **every** new/modified file:
   ```
   full-path | timestamp | size | one-line summary
   ```
5. The toggle values shown in this file are **examples**.  
   First run must honour the values already present in system-config-toggle-v2.md; later runs may tweak them to verify behaviour.
6. Persist browser session (debug port 9222) across the whole workflow.
7. Monitor & document the **state-reset-after-3-categories** issue.
8. Save all agent logs inside their own worktree's logs/ sub-folder.
9. Upon any crash, /zen:debug, commit fix to that worktree branch, then /zen:tracer map call-flow changes, and re-run from PHASE 1.

---

## CRITICAL TOGGLES (must be validated each run)
```json
processing_limits: {
  max_products_per_category: 5,
  min_price_gbp: 0.1,
  max_price_gbp: 20.0,
  price_midpoint_gbp: 20.0,
  max_products_per_run: 12,
  min_products_per_category: 1
}

system: {
  max_products: 999999,
  max_products_per_cycle: 10,
  linking_map_batch_size: 10,
  financial_report_batch_size: 30,
  supplier_extraction_batch_size: 3
}

supplier_cache_control: {
  enabled: true,
  update_frequency_products: 10
}

hybrid_processing: {
  chunked: {
    enabled: true,
    chunk_size_categories: 3
  }
}

batch_synchronization: {
  enabled: false
}
```

                               worktree
```

### AGENT 1: prep-agent (branch prep-run, worktree ../...-prep)
**Tools**: /zen:analyze, /zen:debug

**Tasks**:
- Verify Git version ≥2.5, create worktrees if missing
- Surgical delete of state & cache files (RULE 1)
- Validate Chrome debug port 9222 & login creds
- Snapshot current toggles (no changes yet)
- If any pre-check fails, fix and commit on prep-run

**Gate**: /zen:tracer mark GATE-PREP-OK → trigger exec-agent

---

### AGENT 2: exec-agent (branch test-run, worktree ../...-test)
**Tools**: /zen:debug, /zen:analyze

**Tasks**:
- Run `python run_custom_poundwholesale.py` (current config)
- Wait until it finishes or crashes
- Real-time monitoring: browser persistence, authentication, output-directory creation, processing_state updates
- On normal finish, go to verify-agent
- On crash, capture full traceback, commit patch, rerun

---

### AGENT 3: verify-agent (branch test-run)
**Tools**: /zen:analyze, /zen:tracer

**Tasks**:
- Catalogue every file under OUTPUTS\ (strict rule 4)
- Compare today's log to golden reference; list divergences
- Validate that login fallback fired after 3 no-price items
- Check processing_state integrity vs previous run
- Cross-verify critical toggles → actual behaviour
- If any verification fails, handoff to debug-agent

---

### AGENT 4: debug-agent (branch debug-run, worktree ../...-debug)
**Tools**: /zen:debug, /zen:tracer

**Tasks**:
- Investigate failing module, e.g. AttributeError max_price
- Patch code, increase tests, commit
- Signal exec-agent to rerun on debug-run branch
- Loop until verify-agent passes all gates

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- No "workflow errors" (AttributeError, output_dir, event-loop, etc.)
- All expected output files present & valid (see README list)
- State persists correctly across >3 category batches (no reset)
- Toggle enforcement confirmed or clearly documented
- System ready for infinite-mode (max_products = 999999) without crash

When all criteria met → write **SUCCESS** line in testing_plan.md, append summary to root SUCCESS_LOG.md, and notify user.
